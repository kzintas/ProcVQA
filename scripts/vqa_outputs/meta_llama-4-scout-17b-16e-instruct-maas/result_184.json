  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The visualization shows that after UNC Offense, there are 22 sequences that lead to Made Shot.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows the sequence of events with their corresponding counts. We need to focus on the events \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\" to determine the number of made shots after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## 2: Determine the pathway from UNC Offense to UMD Offense through Made Shot\nFrom \"UNC Offense\", there is a link to \"Rebound\" with a count of 15, and another link to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 22. This indicates that 22 sequences proceed from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\".\n\n## 3: Confirm the connection from Made Shot to UMD Offense\nAfter \"Made Shot\", there is a link to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 22. This confirms that 22 sequences go from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## 4: Conclusion\nGiven that 22 sequences go from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" and then 22 of those sequences proceed to \"UMD Offense\", we can conclude that there were 22 made shots after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows that after UNC Offense, there are 22 sequences that lead to Made Shot. \n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>22</answer>",
