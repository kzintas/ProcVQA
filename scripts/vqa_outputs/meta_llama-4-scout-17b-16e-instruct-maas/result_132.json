  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows the sequence of events with their corresponding counts. We need to focus on the part of the diagram that involves \"UMD Offense\" and the subsequent events.\n\n## 2: Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node and its immediate successors\nThe \"UMD Offense\" node has three immediate successors: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and an unnamed link leading to \"_Exit\" which actually seems to be connected to \"Missed Shot\" and then to \"_Exit\". The counts associated with these links are 34 for \"Rebound\", 14 for \"Missed Shot\", and 21 for the direct link to \"_Exit\".\n\n## 3: Determine the number of missed shots immediately after UMD Offense\nFrom the diagram, we see that there is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n\n## 4: Conclude the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense\nBased on the information provided by the diagram, the number of shots missed immediately after \"UMD Offense\" is directly given by the link count to \"Missed Shot\".\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\nThe number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense is 14.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that immediately after \"UMD Offense\", there is a link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14. This directly answers the question regarding the number of shots missed immediately after \"UMD Offense\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>14</answer>",
