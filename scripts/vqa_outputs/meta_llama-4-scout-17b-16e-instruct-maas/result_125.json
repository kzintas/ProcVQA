  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The node-link diagram shows that after a \"Rebound\", there are two possible outcomes: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n- The link width and numeric label from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" indicate that 15 sequences lead to a \"Made Shot\".",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows various events and their connections. To answer the question, we need to focus on the \"Rebound\" node and its subsequent connections.\n\n## 2: Locate the \"Rebound\" node and its direct outcomes\nThe \"Rebound\" node has two direct outcomes: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\". The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a value of 15, and the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a value of 9.\n\n## 3: Determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound\nWe are interested in the number of shots made directly after a Rebound. The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with 15.\n\n## 4: Confirm that this path represents shots made directly after a Rebound\nSince the question asks for shots made directly after a Rebound, we only consider the path that leads from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", which is 15.\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information from the node-link diagram, 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n\n<reasoning>\n- The node-link diagram shows that after a \"Rebound\", there are two possible outcomes: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n- The link width and numeric label from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" indicate that 15 sequences lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
