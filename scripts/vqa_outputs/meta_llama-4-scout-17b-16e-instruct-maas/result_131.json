  "is_correct": false,

  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe visualization shows the following elements:\n- A starting point labeled \"_Start\" with 69 sequences.\n- The sequences then move to \"UNC Offense\" and then to \"UMD Offense\", both with 69 sequences.\n- From \"UMD Offense\", there are two paths: one leading to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences, and another leading to \"Missed Shot\" with 21 sequences and then to \"_Exit\" with 14 sequences.\n\n## 2: Determine the total sequences from UMD Offense\nThe total sequences from \"UMD Offense\" are split into two paths: \n- One path leads to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences.\n- The other path leads directly to \"Missed Shot\" and then to \"_Exit\" with 21 sequences.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of sequences not transitioning to Rebound\nTo find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to add the sequences that did not lead to \"Rebound\". \nThe sequences that did not lead to \"Rebound\" are those that went to \"Missed Shot\" and then to \"_Exit\", which is 21 sequences.\n\n## 4: Confirm the calculation\nSince all sequences from \"UMD Offense\" are accounted for in the two paths (34 to Rebound and 21 to Missed Shot), and there are no other paths shown, we can directly use the number of sequences that did not lead to \"Rebound\".\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information provided in the diagram, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 21 times (which went to Missed Shot) and also 14 sequences directly exited from Missed Shot, but we are only concerned with the direct split from UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nTo find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we look at the sequences that moved from UMD Offense to Missed Shot. \nThe number of sequences that moved from UMD Offense to Missed Shot is 21.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>21</answer>",
