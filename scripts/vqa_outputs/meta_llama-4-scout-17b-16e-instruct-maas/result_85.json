  "full_response": "## Step-by-step analysis of the node-link diagram:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The diagram shows several sequences of events, starting with _Start_, then moving to **Arrival**, then branching into different paths including **Emergency**, **ICU**, **Floor**, **Discharge-Alive**, **Die**, and ending with **_Exit_**.\n\n2. **Locate the Emergency node**: The **Emergency** node is present in all sequences.\n\n3. **Identify paths leading from Emergency**: \n   - From **Emergency** (12), the path leads directly to **Die** and **_Exit_**.\n   - From **Emergency** (37), the path leads to **Discharge-Alive** and **_Exit_**.\n   - From **Emergency** (24), the path leads to **ICU** (23) and **Floor** (1 patient less than 24, but we do not see a direct link, however 24 - 23 = 1 goes to Die), and **_Exit_** (24).\n   - From **Emergency** (27), the path leads to **Floor** and **_Exit_** (27).\n\n4. **Determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency**: \n   - Directly from the diagram, we see that 12 patients went from **Emergency** to **Die** and **_Exit_**.\n   - Additionally, from **Emergency** to **ICU** to **Die** and **_Exit_**, 1 patient (24 - 23 = 1) died.\n   - There is also a direct path from **Emergency** (27) to **Floor** but no death is associated directly with this path.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency**:\n   - 12 patients died directly after Emergency.\n   - 1 patient died after going through ICU.\n\n## Final calculation:\nThe total number of patients who died after arriving at **Emergency** is 12 + 1 = 13.\n\n## Final Answer:\n<answer>13</answer>",
