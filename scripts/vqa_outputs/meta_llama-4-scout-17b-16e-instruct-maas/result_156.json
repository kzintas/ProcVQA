  "question": "How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The visualization shows that 69 sequences lead into UMD Offense and then split into two paths: 34 to Rebound and 35 to _Exit. This indicates that immediately after UMD Offense, there are 69 sequences that result in either a rebound or an exit.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows the following elements:\n- A starting node labeled \"_Start\"\n- A node labeled \"UNC Offense\" with 69 sequences leading to it from \"_Start\"\n- A node labeled \"UMD Offense\" with 69 sequences leading to it from \"UNC Offense\"\n- Two nodes leading out of \"UMD Offense\": one labeled \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences and another labeled \"_Exit\" with 35 sequences\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations\nTo determine how many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense, we need to look at the paths leading out of the \"UMD Offense\" node. The diagram shows that there are two paths:\n- One path leads to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences\n- Another path leads directly to \"_Exit\" with 35 sequences\n\n## 3: Analyze the paths for missed shots\nSince shots missed would presumably lead to a rebound or an exit (end of sequence), we look at the counts leading out of \"UMD Offense\". \n\n## 4: Calculate the total shots missed\nThe total number of sequences leading out of \"UMD Offense\" is 34 (to Rebound) + 35 (to _Exit) = 69.\n\n## 5: Determine the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense\nGiven that all sequences from \"UMD Offense\" lead to either \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit\", and assuming that a shot missed would result in either a rebound or an exit, we can infer that the total shots missed immediately after UMD Offense would be equal to the total sequences flowing out of it.\n\n## 6: Provide the final answer\nSince there are 69 sequences that lead out of \"UMD Offense\" and into either \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit\", this implies that 69 shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows that 69 sequences lead into UMD Offense and then split into two paths: 34 to Rebound and 35 to _Exit. This indicates that immediately after UMD Offense, there are 69 sequences that result in either a rebound or an exit.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
