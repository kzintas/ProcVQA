  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer\nThe visualization shows several pathways with different event sequences. We need to focus on the events labeled \"Rebound\" and their corresponding counts.\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step\nLooking at the diagram, we can see multiple instances of \"Rebound\" events. Let's track them down:\n- There is a \"Rebound\" event with a count of 14.\n- Another \"Rebound\" event is shown with a count of 7.\n- Additionally, there is a \"Rebound\" event with a count of 11.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of rebounds made by both teams\nTo find the total number of rebounds, we add up the counts of all \"Rebound\" events:\n14 (first instance) + 7 (second instance) + 11 (third instance) = 32\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of rebounds made by both teams can be calculated by adding up the counts of all \"Rebound\" events shown in the diagram.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>32</answer>",
