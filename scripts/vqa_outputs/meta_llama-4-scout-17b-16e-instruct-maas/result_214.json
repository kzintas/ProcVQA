  "full_response": "## Step-by-step analysis of the node-link diagram:\n\n1. **Identify relevant nodes and links**: We need to find nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and their corresponding counts.\n2. **Locate \"Missed Shot\" nodes**: There are three \"Missed Shot\" nodes in the diagram with counts: 7, 14, and 7.\n3. **Sum the counts of \"Missed Shot\" nodes**: To find the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we add the counts of these nodes.\n   - The first \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 7.\n   - The second \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 14.\n   - The third \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 7.\n4. **Calculate the total**: Add the counts together: 7 + 14 + 7 = 28.\n\n## Final answer:\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of missed shots made by both teams can be determined by adding up the counts of all \"Missed Shot\" nodes in the diagram.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>28</answer>",
