  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense, we need to carefully examine the node-link diagram and track the sequences of events related to UMD Offense and free throws.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: We are looking for any nodes or links that mention \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\" or any indication of free throws made.\n\n2. **Locate UMD Offense Nodes**: There are multiple instances of \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram, indicating different pathways or sequences of events.\n\n3. **Identify Free Throw Events**: We need to find nodes or links labeled with \"Made Free Throw\" as these directly relate to free throws made.\n\n4. **Analyze Pathways**: By examining the pathways, we see that there is one direct link to \"Made Free Throw\" with a count of 11 leading from one of the UMD Offense nodes.\n\n5. **Sum Relevant Counts**: Since there is only one explicit count for made free throws by UMD Offense, which is 11, and another node with Made Free Throw 3, we should consider if these are the only instances or if there are other indirect ways free throws are indicated.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the direct counts available, UMD Offense made 3 free throws as there is a direct label \"Made Free Throw | 3\".",
