  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that after \"UNC Offense\", there are 22 sequences that lead to \"Made Shot\".",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows sequences of events with nodes representing events and directed links forming pathways. The vertical position indicates chronological order, and link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path.\n\n## 2: Determine the pathway of interest\nWe need to find the pathway that starts with \"UNC Offense\" and ends before \"UMD Offense\". The relevant nodes and links are: \n- Starting from \"_Start\", the sequence goes to \"UNC Offense\" (69), \n- then to \"Made Shot\" (22), \n- and then to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## 3: Analyze the sequence counts\nFrom \"UNC Offense\", there are two paths: one leading to \"Rebound\" with a count of 15, and another leading to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 22.\n\n## 4: Identify the made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense\nThe count of sequences from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" is 22.\n\n## 5: Confirm the count of made shots\nThere are no other paths or nodes between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Made Shot\" that would alter the count of made shots after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## 6: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information provided in the diagram, there were 22 made shots after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that after \"UNC Offense\", there are 22 sequences that lead to \"Made Shot\". \n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>22</answer>",
