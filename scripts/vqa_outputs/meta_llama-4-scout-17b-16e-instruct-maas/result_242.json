  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer\nThe visualization shows several sequences of events, including missed shots by both teams. We need to locate and count all instances of \"Missed Shot\" for both UNC Offense and UMD Offense.\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>, showing how you analyzed the diagram\n<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to track down all the \"Missed Shot\" events in the diagram.\n\n1. The first sequence shows: \n   - _Start\n   - UNC Offense\n   - Jump Ball\n   - Missed Shot\n   - This sequence has 2 missed shots.\n\n2. The second sequence shows:\n   - _Start\n   - UNC Offense\n   - Rebound\n   - Missed Shot\n   - This sequence has 14 missed shots.\n\n3. The third sequence shows:\n   - _Start\n   - UNC Offense\n   - UMD Offense\n   - Made Shot\n   - This sequence does not have a missed shot directly shown but has a preceding event.\n\n4. The fourth sequence shows:\n   - _Start\n   - UNC Offense\n   - Missed Shot\n   - This sequence has 9 missed shots.\n\n5. The fifth sequence shows:\n   - _Start\n   - UNC Offense\n   - UMD Offense\n   - Rebound\n   - Missed Shot\n   - This sequence has 8 missed shots.\n\n6. The sixth sequence shows:\n   - _Start\n   - UNC Offense\n   - UMD Offense\n   - Missed Shot\n   - This sequence has 6 missed shots.\n\n## 3: Summarize the counts of missed shots\n- 2 (from the first sequence) + 14 (from the second sequence) + 9 (from the fourth sequence) + 8 (from the fifth sequence) + 6 (from the sixth sequence) = 39\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the sequences and focusing on direct mentions and clear paths:\n- Direct counts from visible paths: \n  - 2 (Missed Shot directly shown) + 14 (Missed Shot) + 9 (Missed Shot) + 6 (Missed Shot) + 12 (Missed Shot) = 43\n\nBut accurately summing based on provided numbers and ensuring not to double count or misinterpret:\n- The correct approach should directly sum the \"Missed Shot\" occurrences without assuming additional numbers not directly provided.\n\n## 4: Provide the accurate count based on visualization\nGiven sequences and their direct counts:\n- 2 (Missed Shot)\n- 14 (Missed Shot)\n- 9 (Missed Shot)\n- 6 (Missed Shot)\n- 12 (Missed Shot)\n\n## 5: Calculate the total\nTotal missed shots = 2 + 14 + 9 + 6 + 12 = 43\n\n<answer>43</answer>",
