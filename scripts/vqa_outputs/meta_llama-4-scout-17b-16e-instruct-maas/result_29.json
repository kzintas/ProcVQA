  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The visualization shows that 100 patients start and arrive, then 100 go to Emergency. \nFrom Emergency, 62 patients go to ICU. \nOut of these 62, 36 patients die. \nSo, out of 100 patients who arrived, 36 died after going through Emergency.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows the following sequence of events: \n- Start with 100 patients\n- Arrival of 100 patients\n- Emergency with 62 patients going to ICU and 38 patients to Discharge-Alive\n- From ICU, 36 patients die and 26 patients exit\n\n## 2: Determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency\nTo find out how many patients died after arriving at Emergency, we need to track the pathway from Emergency to Die. \n- 100 patients arrive\n- All 100 go to Emergency\n- From Emergency, 62 go to ICU\n- From ICU, 36 go to Die\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency\nThe number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency can be directly obtained from the link between ICU and Die, which is 36.\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information provided in the diagram, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows that 100 patients start and arrive, then 100 go to Emergency. \nFrom Emergency, 62 patients go to ICU. \nOut of these 62, 36 patients die. \nSo, out of 100 patients who arrived, 36 died after going through Emergency.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>36</answer>",
