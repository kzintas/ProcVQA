  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that 34 sequences lead to \"Rebound\" and 35 sequences lead to \"_Exit\" from \"UMD Offense\". \nTo find the total shots made by UMD offense, we add these two values: 34 + 35 = 69.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows the following elements:\n- A starting node labeled \"_Start\"\n- A node labeled \"UNC Offense\"\n- A node labeled \"UMD Offense\"\n- Two ending nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\"\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of 34\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" has a label of 35\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations\nTo determine the total shots made by the UMD offense, we need to consider all paths that originate from the \"UMD Offense\" node. The diagram shows that from \"UMD Offense\", there are two possible outcomes: \n- One leading to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences\n- The other leading to \"_Exit\" with 35 sequences\n\n## 3: Calculate the total shots made by UMD offense\nThe total shots made by the UMD offense can be calculated by adding the number of sequences leading to \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\". \nTotal shots = 34 (leading to Rebound) + 35 (leading to _Exit) = 69\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information provided in the node-link diagram, the total shots made by the UMD offense is the sum of the sequences leading to \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that 34 sequences lead to \"Rebound\" and 35 sequences lead to \"_Exit\" from \"UMD Offense\". \nTo find the total shots made by UMD offense, we add these two values: 34 + 35 = 69.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
