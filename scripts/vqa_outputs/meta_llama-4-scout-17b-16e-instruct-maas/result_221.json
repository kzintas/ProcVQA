We need to locate and sum up all the missed shots.\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step\nLooking at the diagram, we can see that there are multiple instances of \"Missed Shot\" events. \n- The first instance shows \"Missed Shot | 2\".\n- The second instance shows \"Missed Shot | 25\".\n- The third instance shows \"Missed Shot | 12\".\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of missed shots\nTo find the total number of missed shots, we add up the counts from each instance: \n2 (from the first instance) + 25 (from the second instance) + 12 (from the third instance) = 39\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of missed shots made by both teams can be determined by adding up the counts of all missed shots shown in the diagram.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>39</answer>",
