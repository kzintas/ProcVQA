The nodes have labels such as \"Missed Shot,\" \"Made Shot,\" \"Rebound,\" etc., and the links have numeric labels indicating the count of sequences following that path.\n\n2. **Locate \"Missed Shot\" nodes**: There are three \"Missed Shot\" nodes in the diagram with the following counts:\n   - One \"Missed Shot\" node has 2 sequences.\n   - Another \"Missed Shot\" node has 19 sequences.\n   - The third \"Missed Shot\" node has 19 sequences.\n\n3. **Sum the counts of all \"Missed Shot\" nodes**: \n   - $2 + 19 + 19 = 40$\n\n## Final answer:\n<answer>40</answer>",
