  "reasoning": ", showing how you analyzed the diagram.\n<reasoning>\nTo determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to look for paths that start with \"UNC Offense\" and lead to \"Made Shot\" without including any paths that involve UMD Offense making a shot.\n\n- The first path shows: _Start -> UNC Offense -> Jump Ball -> Missed Shot -> Made Shot with 2 sequences.\n- The second path shows: _Start -> UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Made Free Throw with 10 sequences, and then another path leading to Made Shot with 3 sequences.\n- The third path shows: _Start -> UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense -> Made Shot with 17 sequences.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in shots made directly by the UNC Offense.\n\n## 3: Analyze each path to identify shots made by UNC Offense.\n- Direct shots made by UNC Offense are shown as \"Made Shot\" following UNC Offense paths.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total shots made by UNC Offense.\nFrom the diagram, we see:\n- One path leads to 2 Made Shots.\n- Another path leads to 3 Made Shots.\n- Additionally, there's a path leading to 17 Made Shots.\n\n## 5: Sum the shots made by UNC Offense.\nTo find the total shots made by only the UNC offense, we add the counts of Made Shots directly following UNC Offense paths: 2 (from the first path) + 3 (from the second path) + 17 (from the third path) = 22.\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the process for accuracy:\nThe direct counts from the visualization for Made Shots following UNC Offense are 2, 3, and 17.\n\n## 6: Provide the accurate count based on the visualization.\nUpon careful examination, we find that there are indeed paths leading directly to \"Made Shot\" with counts 2, 3, and 17. But we must ensure we're not double-counting or including UMD Offense's made shots in our total for UNC Offense.\n\n## 7: Verify that we are counting shots made only by UNC Offense.\nThe counts provided directly relate to outcomes of UNC Offense sequences.\n\n## 8: Summarize the findings.\nGiven the paths and their respective counts leading to Made Shot directly from UNC Offense sequences, we find the relevant counts.",
