  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find the total shots made by UMD offense, we look at the node \"Made Shot\" which directly represents shots made. The count next to \"Made Shot\" is 15.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.\nThe visualization shows a node-link diagram with various events and their corresponding sequence counts. The relevant elements for determining the total shots made by UMD offense include the nodes \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\" as they directly relate to shots made or missed.\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step.\nTo find out how many total shots were made by UMD offense, we need to look at the paths that lead to \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\" since these represent the outcomes of shots taken.\n\n- The path leading to \"Made Shot\" has a count of 15.\n- The path leading to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 14.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total shots made.\nThe total shots made can be directly inferred from the \"Made Shot\" node, which has a count of 15. However, to ensure we understand the total shots attempted, we should also consider the \"Missed Shot\" count, which is 14.\n\n## 4: Consider if there are other relevant paths or nodes.\nThere's also a node for \"Rebound\" with a count of 19 leading to _Exit, and another path from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15. But for calculating total shots made, we focus on the \"Made Shot\" node.\n\n## 5: Determine the final count of shots made by UMD offense.\nThe count directly associated with \"Made Shot\" is 15. \n\n## 6: Consider if rebounds lead to additional shots.\nThe count of 19 leading from \"Rebound\" to _Exit indicates rebounds that do not result in shots made or missed within this diagram's context.\n\n## 7: Summarize the findings.\nFrom the diagram, we see that 15 sequences lead to \"Made Shot\".\n\n## 8: Provide the final answer.\nGiven that \"Made Shot\" directly indicates shots made, and there's no indication that rebounds lead to additional shot attempts within the provided counts, we focus solely on the counts provided for \"Made Shot\".\n\n<reasoning>\nTo find the total shots made by UMD offense, we look at the node \"Made Shot\" which directly represents shots made. The count next to \"Made Shot\" is 15. \n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
