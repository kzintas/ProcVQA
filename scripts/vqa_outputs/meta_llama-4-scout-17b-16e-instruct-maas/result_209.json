  "question": "How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?",
  "true_answer": "21",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find out how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, we look for direct connections from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\". \n\nIn the provided node-link diagram, there is one clear pathway that starts with \"UNC Offense\" and directly leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 21. \n\nOther pathways from \"UNC Offense\" lead to various outcomes such as \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Turnover\", etc., but we are only interested in those that directly result in a \"Made Shot\".\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and focusing on direct outcomes from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\", we find that there were 21 shots made directly by the UNC offense.",
  "full_response": "## Step-by-step analysis of the node-link diagram:\n\n1. **Identify relevant elements**: We need to focus on the pathways that originate from \"UNC Offense\" and lead to a \"Made Shot\" without including any pathways that involve \"UMD Offense\" directly making shots.\n\n2. **Track complete pathways**: Looking at the diagram, there are multiple pathways starting from \"UNC Offense\". \n\n3. **Analyze each pathway for made shots by UNC Offense**:\n   - One pathway leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 21.\n   - Other pathways lead to \"Missed Shot\", \"Made Free Throw\", or other outcomes not directly related to shots made by UNC Offense.\n\n4. **Exclude UMD Offense making shots**: We focus only on shots made directly by UNC Offense.\n\n## Detailed reasoning:\n<reasoning>\nTo find out how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, we look for direct connections from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\". \n\nIn the provided node-link diagram, there is one clear pathway that starts with \"UNC Offense\" and directly leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 21. \n\nOther pathways from \"UNC Offense\" lead to various outcomes such as \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Turnover\", etc., but we are only interested in those that directly result in a \"Made Shot\".\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and focusing on direct outcomes from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\", we find that there were 21 shots made directly by the UNC offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n## Final answer:\n<answer>21</answer>",
