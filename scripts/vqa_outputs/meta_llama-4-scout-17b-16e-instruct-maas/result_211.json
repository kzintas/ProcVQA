  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but not after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "21",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find the total missed shots that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but not after \"UMD Offense,\" we should look at paths that originate from \"UNC Offense\" and lead to \"Missed Shot\" without considering paths through \"UMD Offense.\" There are two such paths with counts 7 and 14, respectively.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.\nThe visualization shows several sequences of events, including \"UNC Offense,\" \"UMD Offense,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and others, with corresponding numeric labels indicating the count of sequences following each path.\n\n## 2: Determine the paths that include \"UNC Offense\" followed by \"Missed Shot.\"\nThere are two instances where \"UNC Offense\" is followed by \"Missed Shot\": one with a count of 7 and another with a count of 14.\n\n## 3: Determine the paths that include \"UMD Offense\" followed by \"Missed Shot.\"\nThere is one instance where \"UMD Offense\" is followed by \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 7.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total missed shots after \"UNC Offense\" but not after \"UMD Offense.\"\nThe total missed shots after \"UNC Offense\" are 7 (from the first path) + 14 (from the second path) = 21. However, we need to consider if these are directly after \"UNC Offense\" and not after \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n## 5: Analyze the sequence specifically after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\" or directly connected to them.\n- Directly after \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 7, there is a \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 7.\n- Directly after \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 14, there is a \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n- Directly after \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 15, there is no direct \"Missed Shot\" but a \"Jump Ball\" and then \"UMD Offense\" and other paths.\n\n## 6: Identify sequences that go through \"UNC Offense\" then \"Missed Shot\" without going through \"UMD Offense\" first.\nThere are 7 + 14 = 21 \"Missed Shots\" directly associated with \"UNC Offense\" paths.\n\n## 7: Identify sequences that go through \"UMD Offense\" then \"Missed Shot.\"\nThere is 1 path with \"UMD Offense\" leading to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 7.\n\n## 8: Calculate the total missed shots after \"UNC Offense\" but not after \"UMD Offense.\"\nTo find the total missed shots that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but not after \"UMD Offense,\" we look at the counts directly associated with \"UNC Offense\" leading to \"Missed Shot\": 7 and 14.\n\n## 9: Provide the final count based on the analysis.\nThe counts directly associated with \"UNC Offense\" then \"Missed Shot\" are 7 and 14, which totals to 21. However, we need to ensure we're comparing the right sequences. The question seems to ask for a comparison that isn't directly calculable from given data without assuming indirect relationships.\n\n## 10: Reassess the question for a precise answer.\nGiven that we have:\n- A \"Missed Shot\" of 7 after \"UNC Offense,\"\n- A \"Missed Shot\" of 14 after \"UNC Offense,\"\nand only one sequence of \"Missed Shot\" of 7 after \"UMD Offense,\"\n\n## 11: Final Calculation\nThe total missed shots after \"UNC Offense\" but not directly calculable in a straightforward step due to missing direct sequence comparisons.\n\n<reasoning>\nTo find the total missed shots that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but not after \"UMD Offense,\" we should look at paths that originate from \"UNC Offense\" and lead to \"Missed Shot\" without considering paths through \"UMD Offense.\" There are two such paths with counts 7 and 14, respectively.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>21</answer>",
