  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows a direct transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69. This indicates that UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.\nThe visualization shows a node-link diagram with various events and their corresponding transitions. The question asks about the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## 2: Locate the nodes \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\nThe node \"UNC Offense\" has a link leading directly to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69.\n\n## 3: Determine the number of sequences following the path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\nThe link width and numeric label next to the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" show that there are 69 sequences following this path.\n\n## 4: Verify if there are other paths or transitions that could affect the count.\nThere are no other links or paths shown between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" that would indicate additional transitions.\n\n## 5: Conclude the number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense based on the information provided in the diagram.\nGiven that the link directly from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a count of 69, this directly answers the question.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows a direct transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69. This indicates that UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
