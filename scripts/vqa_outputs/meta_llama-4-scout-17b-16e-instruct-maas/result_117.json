  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The node-link diagram shows that after a Rebound, there are two paths: one leading to \"Made Shot\" with 15 sequences and another to \"Missed Shot\" with 9 sequences.\n- The question specifically asks for shots made directly after a Rebound.\n- The path leading to \"Made Shot\" directly after a Rebound has 15 sequences.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows various events and their connections. To find out how many shots were made directly after a Rebound, we need to locate the \"Rebound\" node and follow its connections.\n\n## 2: Locate the \"Rebound\" node and its direct connections\nThe \"Rebound\" node has two direct connections leading to \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\" with 15 and 9 sequences, respectively.\n\n## 3: Determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound\nFrom the diagram, we see that directly after a Rebound, there are 15 sequences leading to a \"Made Shot\".\n\n## 4: Confirm if there are other paths leading to made shots after a Rebound\nThere are no other paths directly from \"Rebound\" that lead to made shots besides the one with 15 sequences.\n\n## 5: Conclusion\nBased on the information provided by the node-link diagram, 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n\n<reasoning>\n- The node-link diagram shows that after a Rebound, there are two paths: one leading to \"Made Shot\" with 15 sequences and another to \"Missed Shot\" with 9 sequences.\n- The question specifically asks for shots made directly after a Rebound.\n- The path leading to \"Made Shot\" directly after a Rebound has 15 sequences.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
