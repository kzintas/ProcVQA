  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total shots made by UMD offense, we first need to identify all the possible pathways that lead to a shot being made. \n\nLooking at the diagram, we see that from \"UMD Offense\", there are two main paths: one leading to \"Rebound\" and the other to \"Missed Shot\". \n\nThe path leading to \"Rebound\" further branches into \"Made Shot\" and \"_Exit\". The link width and numbers indicate the count of sequences following that path.\n\n- The total sequences from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is 34.\n- From \"Rebound\", there are two paths: one leading to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15 and another to \"_Exit\" with a count of 19.\n\n## Calculating total shots made\n\nTo find the total shots made by UMD offense, we focus on the path that leads to a \"Made Shot\" because that directly represents a shot made.\n\n- The count directly leading from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 15.\n\nThere are no other paths shown that result in a made shot. Therefore, we only consider this direct path for calculating the total shots made.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided in the node-link diagram, the total shots made by UMD offense is directly indicated by the path leading to \"Made Shot\".",
