  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find the number of missed shots before UMD Offense, we need to look at the node-link diagram and find the path that leads directly to UMD Offense. \nThe node \"Missed Shot\" has a direct link to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 24. \nThis indicates that there were 24 sequences where a missed shot occurred before UMD Offense.\n##",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows sequences of events with nodes representing events and directed links representing the flow between these events. The question asks for the number of missed shots before UMD Offense.\n\n## 2: Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram\nThe \"UMD Offense\" node is located in the middle of the diagram, with several nodes and links connecting to and from it.\n\n## 3: Identify the node directly connected to \"UMD Offense\" that represents a shot outcome\nDirectly above \"UMD Offense\", there are two nodes: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n\n## 4: Determine the link width or count associated with \"Missed Shot\" leading to \"UMD Offense\"\nThe link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a numeric label of 24.\n\n## 5: Confirm that this count represents the number of missed shots before UMD Offense\nSince the link from \"Missed Shot\" directly leads to \"UMD Offense\" and has a count of 24, this represents the number of sequences where a missed shot occurred before UMD Offense.\n\n## 6: Provide the final count of missed shots before UMD Offense\nBased on the diagram, there were 24 missed shots before UMD Offense.\n\n## <reasoning>\nTo find the number of missed shots before UMD Offense, we need to look at the node-link diagram and find the path that leads directly to UMD Offense. \nThe node \"Missed Shot\" has a direct link to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 24. \nThis indicates that there were 24 sequences where a missed shot occurred before UMD Offense.\n## </reasoning>\n\n## <answer>24</answer>",
