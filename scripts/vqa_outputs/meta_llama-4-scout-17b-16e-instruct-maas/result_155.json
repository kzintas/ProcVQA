  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we look at the number of sequences that went from UMD Offense to _Exit, which is 35.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe visualization shows a node-link diagram with the following elements:\n- A starting node labeled \"_Start\"\n- A node labeled \"UNC Offense\"\n- A node labeled \"UMD Offense\"\n- Two ending nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\"\n\n## 2: Determine the number of sequences through each link\nFrom \"_Start\" to \"UNC Offense\", there are 69 sequences.\nFrom \"UNC Offense\" or \"_Start\" is not directly connected to \"UMD Offense\", it seems \"UNC Offense\" is directly connected to \"UMD Offense\" but the number of sequences is not explicitly labeled on this link. However, we can see that from \"UMD Offense\", there are 34 sequences to \"Rebound\" and 35 sequences to \"_Exit\".\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of sequences from UMD Offense\nThe total number of sequences from \"UMD Offense\" to either \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit\" is 34 + 35 = 69.\n\n## 4: Analyze the transition from UMD Offense to Rebound and _Exit\nSince all 69 sequences from \"UNC Offense\" go to \"UMD Offense\", and from \"UMD Offense\", 34 go to \"Rebound\" and 35 go to \"_Exit\", we can determine that UMD Offense did not transition to Rebound 35 times.\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\n<reasoning>\nTo find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we look at the number of sequences that went from UMD Offense to _Exit, which is 35.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>35</answer>",
