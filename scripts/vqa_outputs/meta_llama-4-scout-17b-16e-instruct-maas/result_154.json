  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The visualization shows that 69 sequences go from _Start to UNC Offense, and then all 69 sequences go to UMD Offense. Therefore, UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe visualization shows a sequence of events with nodes and directed links. The relevant elements for this question are the nodes \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\", and the links between them with their corresponding counts.\n\n## 2: Analyze the pathway from UNC Offense to UMD Offense\nFrom the visualization, we see that \"UNC Offense\" has a direct link to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69. This indicates that 69 sequences went from \"_Start\" to \"UNC Offense\" and then to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## 3: Determine the transition count from UNC Offense to UMD Offense\nSince all 69 sequences from \"UNC Offense\" go directly to \"UMD Offense\", we can conclude that the entire flow from \"UNC Offense\" transitions to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## 4: Conclusion\nGiven that all sequences from \"UNC Offense\" go to \"UMD Offense\", and there are 69 sequences that go from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\", it means that UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows that 69 sequences go from _Start to UNC Offense, and then all 69 sequences go to UMD Offense. Therefore, UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
