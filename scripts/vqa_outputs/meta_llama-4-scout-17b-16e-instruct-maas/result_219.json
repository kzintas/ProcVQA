  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two rebound events with numeric labels: one with 26 sequences and another with 17 sequences. \nTo find the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we add these two values together.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer\nThe visualization shows several nodes and links representing different events in a basketball game, including rebounds. We need to locate the nodes or links that specifically represent rebounds.\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step\nLooking at the diagram, there are two clear instances where rebounds are mentioned with a count: one with a label \"Rebound\" and a count of 26, and another with \"Rebound\" and a count of 17.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of rebounds made by both teams\nTo find the total number of rebounds, we simply add the counts of rebounds: 26 (from one part of the diagram) and 17 (from another part).\n\n## 4: Provide the final answer\nTotal rebounds = 26 + 17 = 43\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows two rebound events with numeric labels: one with 26 sequences and another with 17 sequences. \nTo find the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we add these two values together.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>43</answer>",
