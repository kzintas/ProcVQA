  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The node labeled \"Rebound\" has a direct link to \"_Exit\" with a count of 24. \nNo other rebounds are indicated in the diagram.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer\nThe node-link diagram shows various events and their connections. To find the total number of rebounds, we need to locate the node labeled \"Rebound\" and examine the link leading to it or from it.\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step\nLooking at the diagram, we see that there is a node labeled \"Rebound\" with a link leading to \"_Exit\" and a numeric label next to the link showing \"24\". This indicates that there are 24 sequences leading from \"Rebound\" to \"_Exit\".\n\n## 3: Analyze the diagram to ensure no other rebounds are shown\nThere are no other nodes or links labeled \"Rebound\" elsewhere in the diagram that would suggest additional rebounds.\n\n## 4: Determine the total number of rebounds\nBased on the information provided in the diagram, the total number of rebounds is directly shown next to the \"Rebound\" node leading to \"_Exit\", which is 24.\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\nGiven that there is only one clear path leading to \"_Exit\" from \"Rebound\" with a count of 24, we can conclude that there are 24 rebounds in total.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node labeled \"Rebound\" has a direct link to \"_Exit\" with a count of 24. \nNo other rebounds are indicated in the diagram.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
