  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that after \"UNC Offense\", there is a direct link to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1. This indicates that a Jump Ball occurred 1 time after UNC Offense.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer\nThe visualization shows several sequences of events related to UNC Offense and UMD Offense, including rebounds, missed shots, made shots, turnovers, fouls, and more. We need to focus on the sequences that follow \"UNC Offense\" and specifically look for a \"Jump Ball\" event.\n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step\nLooking at the provided node-link diagram visualization, we need to track the pathways that start with \"UNC Offense\" and see if there's a \"Jump Ball\" event directly following it. \n\n## 3: Analyze the diagram for the occurrence of a Jump Ball after UNC Offense\nUpon examining the diagram, there's a direct link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1. This indicates that a Jump Ball occurred once after UNC Offense.\n\n## 4: Consider all possible pathways and their counts\nThere are multiple pathways starting from \"UNC Offense\", but we are specifically interested in those that lead to a \"Jump Ball\". The count next to the link leading to \"Jump Ball\" from \"UNC Offense\" is 1.\n\n## 5: Determine the final count of Jump Ball occurrences after UNC Offense\nBased on the information provided in the diagram, there is 1 occurrence of a Jump Ball after UNC Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that after \"UNC Offense\", there is a direct link to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1. This indicates that a Jump Ball occurred 1 time after UNC Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
