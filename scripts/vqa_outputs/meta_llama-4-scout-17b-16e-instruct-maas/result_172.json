  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "49",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two rebound nodes with 15 and 7 sequences leading to them respectively.",
  "full_response": "## Step-by-step analysis of the node-link diagram:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows several nodes and links representing different events in a match. The events of interest here are \"Rebound\" and their respective counts.\n\n2. **Locate Rebound Nodes**: There are two \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram. One is directly under \"UNC Offense\" and the other is under \"UMD Offense\".\n\n3. **Track Rebound Counts**: \n   - Under \"UNC Offense\", there is one \"Rebound\" node with 15 sequences leading to it and 8 sequences leading from it.\n   - Under \"UMD Offense\", there is another \"Rebound\" node with 7 sequences leading to it and 24 sequences leading from it.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Rebounds**: \n   - The total number of rebounds can be calculated by adding the counts of sequences leading to and from the \"Rebound\" nodes. However, the question seems to be asking for the total count of rebounds directly shown in the diagram.\n   - Directly shown counts for rebounds are 15 (leading to UNC Offense Rebound) and 7 (leading to UMD Offense Rebound).\n\n5. **Sum the Rebound Counts**: \n   - Total rebounds = 15 (from UNC Offense) + 7 (from UMD Offense) = 22\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems there might have been an oversight in the direct calculation:\n- There's a link with 15 leading to \"Rebound\" under UNC Offense and 7 leading to \"Rebound\" under UMD Offense.\n\n## Final Calculation:\nThe actual calculation directly from the diagram for total rebounds seems to consider where \"Rebound\" leads and comes from, but specifically, we see:\n- 15 (to UNC Rebound) and 7 (to UMD Rebound).\n\n## Answer:\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows two rebound nodes with 15 and 7 sequences leading to them respectively. \n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>22</answer>",
