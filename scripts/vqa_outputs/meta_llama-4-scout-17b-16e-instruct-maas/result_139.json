  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we looked at the paths leading from UMD Offense. \nThe path to Rebound has 34 sequences, \nthe path to Missed Shot has 21 sequences, \nand the path to _Exit has 14 sequences. \nSo, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound in 21 + 14 = 35 sequences.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe visualization shows that 69 sequences start with \"Start\" and transition to \"UNC Offense\", then 69 sequences transition to \"UMD Offense\". From \"UMD Offense\", there are three paths: one leading to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences, one to \"Missed Shot\" with 21 sequences, and one directly to \"_Exit\" with 14 sequences.\n\n## 2: Determine the total sequences transitioning from UMD Offense\nThe total sequences transitioning from \"UMD Offense\" can be calculated by adding the sequences of all paths leading from it: 34 (to Rebound) + 21 (to Missed Shot) + 14 (to _Exit) = 69.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound\nTo find out how many times \"UMD Offense\" did not transition to a \"Rebound\", we need to add the sequences that went to \"Missed Shot\" and directly to \"_Exit\". The sequences that went to \"Missed Shot\" are 21, and directly to \"_Exit\" are 14.\n\n## 4: Sum the sequences that did not lead to Rebound\nThe sequences that did not lead to \"Rebound\" are 21 (to Missed Shot) + 14 (to _Exit) = 35.\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\n<reasoning>\nTo find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we looked at the paths leading from UMD Offense. \nThe path to Rebound has 34 sequences, \nthe path to Missed Shot has 21 sequences, \nand the path to _Exit has 14 sequences. \nSo, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound in 21 + 14 = 35 sequences.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
