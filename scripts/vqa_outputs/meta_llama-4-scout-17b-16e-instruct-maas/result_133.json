  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The node \"Rebound\" has a direct link to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n- This indicates that 15 sequences proceeded from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe node-link diagram shows the sequence of events with their corresponding counts. We need to focus on the path that leads from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n\n## 2: Locate the \"Rebound\" node and its subsequent nodes\nThe \"Rebound\" node has two outgoing links: one to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15, and another to \"_Exit\" with a count of 19.\n\n## 3: Determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound\nFrom the diagram, we see that there is a direct link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n\n## 4: Confirm that this count represents shots made directly after a Rebound\nSince the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a count of 15, this directly tells us how many shots were made after a rebound.\n\n## 5: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information from the diagram, 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n\n<reasoning>\n- The node \"Rebound\" has a direct link to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n- This indicates that 15 sequences proceeded from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
