  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that there is a direct link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69. This directly answers the question of how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense.",
  "full_response": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe visualization shows a node-link diagram with the following elements: \n- A starting node labeled \"_Start\" \n- A node labeled \"UNC Offense\" \n- A node labeled \"UMD Offense\" \n- Two ending nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\" \n- The links and their corresponding counts are as follows: \n  - From \"_Start\" to \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 69 \n  - From \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69 \n  - From \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 \n  - From \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35 \n\n## 2: Describe the thought process and calculations\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to look at the link directly connecting these nodes. \nThe link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a count of 69. This indicates that 69 sequences transitioned from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". \n\n## 3: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information provided in the visualization, UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that there is a direct link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69. This directly answers the question of how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
