From the \"Arrival\" node, there are 27 patients.\n2. Out of these 27 patients, 23 go to the \"Floor\".\n3. From the \"Floor\" node, 20 patients are discharged alive.\n\nBy following this pathway, we can calculate the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n\n### Calculation:\n- Total patients arriving: 27\n- Patients going to Floor: 23\n- Patients discharged alive from Floor: 20\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 20.\n\n<answer>20</answer>",
