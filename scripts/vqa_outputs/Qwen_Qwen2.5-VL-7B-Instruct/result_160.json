  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\n1. The diagram represents a sequence of events in a basketball game.\n2. The starting point is labeled as \"_Start\" with 69 sequences.\n3. From \"_Start,\" there's a split into two paths: \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense.\"\n4. Both \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" have 69 sequences leading to them.\n5. The \"UMD Offense\" path leads to two outcomes: \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit.\"\n6. The link width between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Rebound\" is 34, indicating 34 sequences.\n7. The link width between \"UMD Offense\" and \"_Exit\" is 35, indicating 35 sequences.\n8. Since the question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to consider the sequences leading to \"_Exit\" because free throws are typically taken when a team is at the free throw line.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
