  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Floor\" and then to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n1. From the \"Arrival\" node, there are 27 patients.\n2. These patients go to the \"Floor\" node, which has 23 patients.\n3. From the \"Floor\" node, 20 patients are discharged alive.\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the sum of the patients who went directly from \"Arrival\" to \"Floor\" and those who went through \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n### Calculation:\n- Patients arriving at the Floor: 23\n- Patients discharged alive from the Floor: 20\n\nTotal discharged alive = 23 + 20 = 43\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>43</answer>",
