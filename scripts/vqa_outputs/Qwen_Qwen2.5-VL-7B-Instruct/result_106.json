Identify the node labeled \"Arrival\" under the \"Emergency\" section.\n2. Trace the pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Die\".\n3. Check the number associated with the link between \"Arrival\" and \"Die\".\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The \"Arrival\" node under \"Emergency\" has a value of 37.\n- There is a link from \"Arrival\" to \"Die\" with a value of 12.\n\nThis means that out of the 37 patients who arrived at Emergency, 12 patients died.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>12</answer>",
