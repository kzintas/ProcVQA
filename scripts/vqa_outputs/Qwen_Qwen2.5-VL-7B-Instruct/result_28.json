  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from the start to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. From the start, 100 patients go to \"Arrival\".\n2. From \"Arrival\", 100 patients go to \"Emergency\".\n3. From \"Emergency\", 62 patients go to \"ICU\" and 38 patients go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThe pathway to \"Discharge-Alive\" is directly from \"Emergency\" without passing through \"ICU\". Therefore, the number of patients discharged alive is the sum of those who went directly from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n### Calculation:\n- Number of patients from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\": 38\n\nThus, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 38.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
