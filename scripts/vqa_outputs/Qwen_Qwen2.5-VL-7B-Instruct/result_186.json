Identify the \"Rebound\" nodes: There are two \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram.\n2. Examine the links leading to \"_Exit\" from these \"Rebound\" nodes:\n   - One link from \"Rebound\" to \"_Exit\" has a label of 15.\n   - The other link also leads to \"_Exit\" and has an implied value of 15.\n3. Sum the values of the links leading to \"_Exit\" from \"Rebound\":\n   - 15 + 15 = 30\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>30</answer>",
