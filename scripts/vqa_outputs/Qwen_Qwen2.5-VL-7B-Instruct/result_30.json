  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the start to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. Start at the top node labeled \"_Start\".\n2. Follow the link to \"Arrival\", which has 100 patients.\n3. From \"Arrival\", there are two paths leading to \"Emergency\". One path leads to \"ICU\" with 62 patients, and the other leads directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n4. We do not need to consider the \"Die\" pathway as it does not lead to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of the patients who go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Emergency\".\n\n### Calculation:\n- Patients going directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Emergency\": 38\n\nThus, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
