  "full_response": "### Reasoning\nTo determine how many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting point: The `_Start` node represents the beginning of the sequence.\n2. Trace the pathway from `_Start` to `Arrival`: This confirms the patients arrived at the Emergency department.\n3. From `Arrival`, trace the pathway to `Discharge-Alive`: This represents the patients who were discharged alive.\n\nThe link width between `Arrival` and `Discharge-Alive` indicates the number of patients who followed this pathway.\n\n### Answer\n<answer>37</answer>",
