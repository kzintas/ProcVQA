  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\n1. The diagram starts at the `_Start` node, which has 69 sequences leading to `UNC Offense`.\n2. From `UNC Offense`, there's a link to `UMD Offense` with 69 sequences.\n3. From `UMD Offense`, there are two paths: one to `Rebound` with 34 sequences and another to `_Exit` with 35 sequences.\n\nSince the question asks about \"shots missed immediately after UMD Offense,\" we need to consider the transitions directly from `UMD Offense`. The only immediate transition from `UMD Offense` is to `_Exit`, which represents missed shots.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
