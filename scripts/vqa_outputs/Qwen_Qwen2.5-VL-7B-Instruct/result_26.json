  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine how many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\n1. From the \"Arrival\" node, there are two pathways leading to \"Emergency\".\n2. One pathway leads to \"ICU\" with 62 patients.\n3. Another pathway leads to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n\nSince the question asks specifically about patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we focus on the pathway that leads directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThe link width between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is labeled as 38, which means 38 patients followed this pathway.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
