For UNC Offense:\n   - Made Shot: 2\n\n2. For UMD Offense:\n   - Made Shot: 20\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of made shots:\n\nTotal Made Shots = Made Shot (UNC Offense) + Made Shot (UMD Offense)\n                  = 2 + 20\n                  = 22\n\n### Answer:\n<answer>22</answer>",
