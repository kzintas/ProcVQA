From the \"Arrival\" node, there is a link to \"Emergency\" with 27 patients.\n2. From \"Emergency\", there is a link to \"Floor\" with 23 patients.\n3. From \"Floor\", there is a link to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 20 patients.\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the sum of the patients at each step along this pathway.\n\n### Calculation:\n- Patients arriving: 27\n- Patients reaching Floor: 23\n- Patients discharged alive from Floor: 20\n\nTotal = 27 + 23 + 20 = 70\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>70</answer>",
