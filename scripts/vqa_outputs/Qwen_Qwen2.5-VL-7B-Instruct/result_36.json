  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The node `_Start` has 100 patients.\n- There are two pathways leading from `Emergency`: one to `Floor` and another to `ICU`.\n- From `Floor`, there is a link to `Discharge-Alive` with a value of 38.\n- From `ICU`, there is also a link to `Discharge-Alive` with a value of 24.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. Start at `_Start` with 100 patients.\n2. Follow the pathway from `_Start` to `Emergency`. There are two branches here.\n3. From `Emergency`, 21 patients go to `Floor` and 38 patients go to `ICU`.\n4. From `Floor`, 38 patients are discharged alive (`Discharge-Alive`).\n5. From `ICU`, 24 patients are discharged alive (`Discharge-Alive`).\n\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, sum the patients from both pathways:\n\\[ \\text{Total Discharged Alive} = 38 (\\text{from Floor}) + 24 (\\text{from ICU}) = 62 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>62</answer>",
