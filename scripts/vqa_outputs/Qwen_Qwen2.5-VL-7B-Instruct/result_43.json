  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine how many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two possible paths:\n   - One leads to \"Floor\" with 41 patients.\n   - Another leads to \"ICU\" with 21 patients.\n\n2. From both \"Floor\" and \"ICU\", there are further paths leading to \"Discharge-Alive\":\n   - From \"Floor\", 24 patients go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n   - From \"ICU\", 36 patients go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n3. Summing these numbers gives us the total number of patients discharged alive directly after an Emergency:\n   - 24 (from Floor) + 36 (from ICU) = 60\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>60</answer>",
