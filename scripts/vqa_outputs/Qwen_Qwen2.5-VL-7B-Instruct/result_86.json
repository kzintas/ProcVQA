  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". We can see two pathways leading to \"Discharge-Alive\":\n\n1. From \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. From \"Arrival\" directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThe number of patients for each pathway can be found by summing the counts along these paths.\n\n#### Path 1: Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive\n- Arrival: 12\n- Emergency: 12\n- Discharge-Alive: 37\n\nTotal for Path 1 = 12 + 12 + 37 = 61\n\n#### Path 2: Arrival -> Discharge-Alive\n- Arrival: 27\n- Discharge-Alive: 20\n\nTotal for Path 2 = 27 + 20 = 47\n\nAdding both paths together gives us the total number of patients discharged alive.\n\n### Calculation:\nTotal discharged alive = Total for Path 1 + Total for Path 2\n= 61 + 47\n= 108\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>108</answer>",
