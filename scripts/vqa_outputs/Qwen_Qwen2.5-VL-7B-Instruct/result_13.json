  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the start to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. Start at the top node labeled \"_Start\".\n2. Follow the link to \"Arrival\", which has 100 patients.\n3. From \"Arrival\", there are two paths leading to \"Emergency\". One path leads to \"ICU\" with 62 patients, and another to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n4. From \"ICU\", there are two paths: one to \"Die\" with 36 patients, and another to \"Floor\" with 24 patients.\n5. From \"Floor\", there is only one path to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 24 patients.\n6. From \"Emergency\", there is also a direct path to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of the patients who went directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Emergency\" and those who went through \"ICU\" and then \"Floor\".\n\n### Calculation:\n- Patients from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\": 38\n- Patients from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\": 24\n\nTotal = 38 + 24 = 62\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>62</answer>",
