  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine how many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\n1. Start at the \"Arrival\" node, which has 100 patients.\n2. From \"Arrival\", there are two pathways: one leading to \"ICU\" and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. The link width between \"Arrival\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is labeled as 38.\n\nSince the question asks specifically about the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we focus on the pathway that leads directly from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
