  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to look at the pathway from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\". The link width represents the number of sequences following that path.\n\n1. From the diagram, there are two paths originating from \"UMD Offense\":\n   - One leads to \"Rebound\" with a link width of 34.\n   - The other leads to \"_Exit\" with a link width of 35.\n\n2. Since the total number of sequences from \"UMD Offense\" is 69 (as indicated by the label above it), and 34 sequences go to \"Rebound\", the remaining sequences must have gone to \"_Exit\".\n\n3. Therefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is the number of sequences that went to \"_Exit\", which is 35.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
