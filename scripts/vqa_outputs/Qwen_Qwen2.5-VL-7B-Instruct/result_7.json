  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the start to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. Start at the top node labeled \"_Start\".\n2. Follow the link to \"Arrival\", which has 100 patients.\n3. From \"Arrival\", there are two paths leading to \"Emergency\". One path leads to \"ICU\" with 62 patients, and the other to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n4. From \"ICU\", there are two paths: one to \"Die\" with 36 patients, and another to \"Floor\" with 24 patients.\n5. From \"Floor\", there is only one path to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 24 patients.\n6. Summing up the patients who were discharged alive from both paths: 38 (from Emergency directly) + 24 (from Floor).\n\n### Calculation:\n- Patients discharged alive from Emergency: 38\n- Patients discharged alive from Floor: 24\n\nTotal discharged alive = 38 + 24 = 62\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>62</answer>",
