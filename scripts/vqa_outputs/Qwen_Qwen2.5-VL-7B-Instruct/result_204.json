Identify the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense.\"\n2. Look for any nodes between these two labeled nodes that represent missed shots.\n3. Sum the counts of these missed shots.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The \"UNC Offense\" node has a link leading to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 7.\n- There are no other nodes between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" that represent missed shots.\n\nThus, the only missed shot that occurs after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is the one with a count of 7.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>7</answer>",
