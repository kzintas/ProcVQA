Identify the \"Missed Shot\" nodes for UNC and UMD.\n2. Count the number of sequences leading to \"Missed Shot\" for UNC.\n3. Count the number of sequences leading to \"Missed Shot\" for UMD.\n4. Add the two counts together.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- UNC has 2 + 14 + 10 = 26 missed shots.\n- UMD has 9 + 8 + 6 = 23 missed shots.\n\nTotal missed shots = 26 (UNC) + 23 (UMD) = 49\n\n### Answer:\n<answer>49</answer>",
