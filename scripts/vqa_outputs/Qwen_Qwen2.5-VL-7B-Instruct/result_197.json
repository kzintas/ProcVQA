  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The node labeled \"UNC Offense\" has two outgoing links.\n- One link leads to \"Made Shot\" with a label of 22.\n- Another link leads to \"Missed Shot\" with a label of 24.\n- The node labeled \"Made Shot\" has an incoming link from \"UNC Offense\" with a label of 22.\n- The node labeled \"Missed Shot\" has an incoming link from \"UNC Offense\" with a label of 24.\n\n### Thought Process:\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to look at the transitions from \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\" back to \"Rebound\". However, there is no direct link from \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" in this diagram. Instead, we see a direct link from \"Rebound\" back to \"_Exit\".\n\nSince the question asks specifically about transitions from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\", and there is no direct link from \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\", it implies that the transitions are not directly observable in the given diagram.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>\n",
