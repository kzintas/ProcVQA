  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine how many patients died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting point: The `_Start` node represents the beginning of the sequence.\n2. Follow the pathway from `_Start` to `Arrival`: This is the first event in the sequence.\n3. From `Arrival`, trace the pathway to `Emergency`.\n4. From `Emergency`, look for the pathway leading to `Die`.\n\nThe link width and numeric label indicate the number of sequences that follow each path.\n\n- From `_Start` to `Arrival`: 12 sequences.\n- From `Arrival` to `Emergency`: 12 sequences.\n- From `Emergency` to `Die`: 12 sequences.\n\nEach of these sequences represents a patient's journey through the system.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>12</answer>",
