  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathway from \"Start\" to \"Rebound\" and then to \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\".\n\n1. From the \"Start\" node, there is a link to \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n2. From \"UMD Offense\", there is a link to \"Rebound\" with a value of 34.\n\nThe value of 34 represents the number of sequences that follow this path. Since the link width is proportional to the number of sequences, the value 34 directly gives us the total number of rebounds made by UMD Offense.\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
