  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The starting point is labeled as \"_Start\" with 100 patients.\n- From \"_Start\", there are two paths leading to \"Emergency\".\n- One path leads to \"ICU\" with 62 patients.\n- Another path leads directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n- From \"ICU\", there are two paths: one to \"Floor\" with 24 patients, and another to \"Die\" with 36 patients.\n- From \"Floor\", there is only one path to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 24 patients.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. Start at the top node labeled \"_Start\" with 100 patients.\n2. Follow the path from \"_Start\" to \"Emergency\". There are two branches here: one to \"ICU\" and one to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. From \"Emergency\", 62 patients go to \"ICU\" and 38 patients go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4. From \"ICU\", 24 patients go to \"Floor\" and 36 patients go to \"Die\".\n5. From \"Floor\", 24 patients go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the sum of the patients who went from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", which is 24.\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
