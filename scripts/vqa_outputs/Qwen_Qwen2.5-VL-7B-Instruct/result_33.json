  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The node labeled \"ICU\" has two outgoing links.\n- One link leads to \"Die\" with 36 patients.\n- Another link leads to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n- There is no direct link from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\".\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. The node \"ICU\" represents a point where patients can either die or be discharged alive.\n2. Since there is no direct link from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\", it implies that patients do not go directly to the Floor from the ICU.\n3. The number of patients going to the Floor cannot be determined from the given data as there is no pathway leading to \"Floor\" from \"ICU\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
