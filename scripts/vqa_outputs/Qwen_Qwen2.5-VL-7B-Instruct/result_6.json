Start at the \"_Start\" node, which has 100 patients.\n2. Follow the path from \"_Start\" to \"Arrival\". There are 100 patients here.\n3. From \"Arrival\", the patients split into two paths: one to \"ICU\" and one to \"Discharge-Alive\". There are 62 patients going to \"ICU\" and 38 patients going to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4. From \"ICU\", there are two branches: one leading to \"Die\" and the other to \"Floor\". There are 36 patients going to \"Die\" and 24 patients going to \"Floor\".\n5.
