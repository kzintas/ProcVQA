  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The starting point is labeled as \"_Start\" with 100 patients.\n- From \"_Start\", there is a link to \"Arrival\" with 100 patients.\n- From \"Arrival\", there are two pathways: one leading to \"ICU\" and another to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n- The pathway to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of 38.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. The total number of patients arriving at the Emergency department is 100.\n2. Out of these 100 patients, 62 go to the ICU.\n3. The remaining patients, which is 100 - 62 = 38, must have been discharged alive since there are no other pathways from \"Arrival\" except for \"ICU\" and \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
