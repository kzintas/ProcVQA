  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The node labeled \"Arrival\" is the starting point.\n- From \"Arrival,\" there is a link to \"Emergency.\"\n- From \"Emergency,\" there are two paths: one leading to \"Floor\" and another to \"ICU.\"\n- From \"ICU,\" there is a link to \"Die.\"\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. Start at the \"Arrival\" node, which has 100 patients.\n2. Follow the path from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency.\" There are 100 patients here.\n3. From \"Emergency,\" 41 patients go to \"Floor\" and 36 patients go to \"ICU.\"\n4. From \"ICU,\" 21 patients die, as indicated by the link to \"Die.\"\n\n### Calculation:\nThe number of patients who died after arriving at \"Emergency\" is the sum of patients who went to \"ICU\" and then died.\n\n\\[ \\text{Patients who died} = \\text{Patients who went to ICU} \\times \\text{Probability of dying} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Patients who died} = 36 \\times \\frac{21}{36} \\]\n\nHowever, since the probability is not given, we assume the entire 36 patients who went to ICU died.\n\nThus, the number of patients who died after arriving at \"Emergency\" is 21.\n\n<answer>21</answer>",
