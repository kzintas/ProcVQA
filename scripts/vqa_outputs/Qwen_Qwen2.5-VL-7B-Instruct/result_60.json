  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the start to the \"Discharge-Alive\" exit.\n\n1. Start at the top node labeled \"_Start\".\n2. Follow the link to \"Arrival\", which has 100 patients.\n3. From \"Arrival\", there are two paths:\n   - One leads to \"Emergency\" with 62 patients.\n   - The other leads to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n4. Since we are interested in the \"Discharge-Alive\" pathway, we follow this link.\n5. At the end of the \"Discharge-Alive\" pathway, there is an exit labeled \"Exit\" with 38 patients.\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of the patients who took the \"Discharge-Alive\" pathway, which is 38.\n\n<answer>38</answer>",
