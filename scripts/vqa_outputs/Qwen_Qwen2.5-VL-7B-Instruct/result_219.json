Identify the \"Rebound\" nodes for both teams.\n   - For UNC Offense, there is 1 \"Rebound\" node with a link width of 26.\n   - For UMD Offense, there is 1 \"Rebound\" node with a link width of 17.\n\n2. Sum the number of rebounds for both teams.\n   - UNC Offense Rebounds = 26\n   - UMD Offense Rebounds = 17\n\n3. Total Rebounds = UNC Offense Rebounds + UMD Offense Rebounds\n   - Total Rebounds = 26 + 17 = 43\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>43</answer>",
