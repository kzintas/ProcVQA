  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the start to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. Start at the top node labeled \"_Start\".\n2. Follow the link to \"Arrival\", which has 100 patients.\n3. From \"Arrival\", there are two paths: one to \"Emergency\" and another to \"Floor\".\n4. From \"Emergency\", there are two paths: one to \"Discharge-Alive\" and another to \"Floor\".\n5. From \"Floor\", there are two paths: one to \"ICU\" and another to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n6. From \"ICU\", there are two paths: one to \"Floor\" and another to \"Die\".\n\nThe path leading directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Emergency\" is the most straightforward route for discharge alive. The number of patients following this path is 38.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
