  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The node labeled \"UNC Offense\" has two outgoing links.\n- One link leads to \"Made Shot\" with 22 sequences.\n- Another link leads to \"Missed Shot\" with 24 sequences.\n- From both \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot,\" there is an outgoing link to \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The link width between \"Made Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" is 22.\n- The link width between \"Missed Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" is 24.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. The question asks for the number of fouls made after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense.\n2. The sequence of events starts at \"_Start\" and goes through \"UNC Offense.\"\n3. From \"UNC Offense,\" there are two paths: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot.\"\n4. Both \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\" lead to \"UMD Offense.\"\n5. The link widths indicate the number of sequences for each transition.\n6. The link width from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 22.\n7. The link width from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 24.\n8. Since the question does not specify which path was taken, we consider both possibilities.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>22</answer>",
