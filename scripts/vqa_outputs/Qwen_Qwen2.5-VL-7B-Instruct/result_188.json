  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The node labeled \"Rebound\" appears after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- There is a link from \"Rebound\" to \"_Exit,\" which has a label of 15.\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. Identify the pathway from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound.\"\n2. Check if there is any link from \"Rebound\" to another node that could represent a steal.\n3. The only link from \"Rebound\" leads to \"_Exit,\" which has a label of 15.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe link from \"Rebound\" to \"_Exit\" with a label of 15 suggests that 15 sequences follow this path. Since no other link from \"Rebound\" is visible, it implies that 15 sequences do not involve a steal but rather exit directly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>\n",
