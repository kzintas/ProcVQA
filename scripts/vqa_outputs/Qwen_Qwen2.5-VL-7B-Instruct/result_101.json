  "full_response": "### Reasoning:\nTo determine how many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting point: The `_Start` node represents the beginning of the sequence.\n2. Follow the pathway from `_Start` to `Arrival`: This is the first event in the sequence.\n3. From `Arrival`, trace the pathway to `Emergency`: This is the second event in the sequence.\n4. From `Emergency`, trace the pathway to `Discharge-Alive`: This is the third event in the sequence.\n\nThe link width between `Arrival` and `Emergency` is 37, which means there are 37 sequences following this path. The link width between `Emergency` and `Discharge-Alive` is also 37, indicating that all 37 patients who arrived at Emergency were discharged alive.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>37</answer>",
