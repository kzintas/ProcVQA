  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The node labeled \"Start\" has 69 sequences leading to it.\n- From \"Start,\" there's a link to \"UNC Offense\" with 69 sequences.\n- From \"Start,\" there's also a link to \"UMD Offense\" with 69 sequences.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two paths: one to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences and another to \"_Exit\" with 35 sequences.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. The total number of sequences starting at \"Start\" is 69.\n2. These 69 sequences split into two paths: one for \"UNC Offense\" and one for \"UMD Offense.\"\n3. Since the total number of sequences from \"Start\" is 69 and they split equally between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense,\" each path should have 34.5 sequences. However, since we cannot have half a sequence, this suggests an error in the interpretation or the data provided might not be perfectly balanced.\n4. The question asks specifically about the \"UMD Offense.\" According to the diagram, the total number of sequences leading directly from \"UMD Offense\" to either \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit\" is 34 + 35 = 69.\n5. Therefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is the sum of the sequences leading to \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit,\" which is 34 + 35 = 69.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>69</answer>",
