  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The starting node labeled as `_Start` has 69 sequences.\n- The node `UMD Offense` branches into two paths: one leading to `Rebound` and another leading to `Missed Shot`.\n- The link width between `_Start` and `UMD Offense` is 69, indicating there are 69 sequences leading to `UMD Offense`.\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. From `_Start`, 69 sequences lead to `UMD Offense`.\n2. Out of these 69 sequences, 34 sequences lead to `Rebound`.\n3. Therefore, the remaining sequences must have led to other outcomes.\n\n### Calculation:\n- Total sequences to `UMD Offense`: 69\n- Sequences to `Rebound`: 34\n- Sequences not to `Rebound`: 69 - 34 = 35\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
