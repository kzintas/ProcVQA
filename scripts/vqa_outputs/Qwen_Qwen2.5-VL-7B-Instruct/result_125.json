The \"Rebound\" node has two outgoing links.\n2. One link leads to \"Made Shot\" with a label of 15.\n3. The other link leads to \"Missed Shot\" with a label of 9.\n\nThe label next to the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 15, which represents the number of sequences that follow this path.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>15</answer>",
