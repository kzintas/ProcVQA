  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The starting point is labeled as \"_Start\" with 100 patients.\n- From \"_Start\", there is a link to \"Arrival\" with 100 patients.\n- From \"Arrival\", there is a link to \"Emergency\".\n- From \"Emergency\", there are two paths: one leading to \"ICU\" with 62 patients and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. Start at the top node labeled \"_Start\" which has 100 patients.\n2. Follow the pathway from \"_Start\" to \"Arrival\" which also has 100 patients.\n3. From \"Arrival\", the patients go either to \"Emergency\" or \"Exit\". Since we are interested in the patients who went to \"Discharge-Alive\", we follow the path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4. The number of patients who went from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is given as 38.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
