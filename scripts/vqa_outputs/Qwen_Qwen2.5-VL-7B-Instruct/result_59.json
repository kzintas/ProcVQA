  "full_response": "### Relevant Elements:\n- The starting node labeled as \"_Start\" with 100 patients.\n- The \"Arrival\" node with 100 patients.\n- The \"Emergency\" node branching into two paths: \"ICU\" and \"Discharge-Alive\".\n- The \"ICU\" path has 36 patients leading to \"Die\" and 26 patients leading to \"_Exit\".\n- The \"Discharge-Alive\" path has 38 patients leading to \"_Exit\".\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. Start at the \"_Start\" node with 100 patients.\n2. Move to the \"Arrival\" node, which also has 100 patients.\n3. From \"Arrival\", the flow splits into \"Emergency\".\n4. At \"Emergency\", there are two paths: \"ICU\" and \"Discharge-Alive\".\n5. The \"ICU\" path leads to \"Die\" with 36 patients.\n6. The \"Discharge-Alive\" path leads to \"_Exit\" with 38 patients.\n\nThe question asks specifically about patients who died after arriving at \"Emergency\". According to the diagram, these patients would have followed the path from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" and then to \"ICU\" and finally to \"Die\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>36</answer>",
