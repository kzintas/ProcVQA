  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes:** The question asks about \"missed shots\". We need to find all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and sum the incoming link counts to those nodes.\n2. **Trace pathways to \"Missed Shot\" nodes:**\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected from \"Start\" with a link count of 2.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected from \"Rebound\" with a link count of 25.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected from \"UMD Offense\" with a link count of 12.\n3. **Sum the link counts:** 2 + 25 + 12 = 39",
