  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of steals after UMD Offense. I examined the diagram for any node labeled \"Steal\" that is reachable from the \"UMD Offense\" node via directed links. I found no such node. The diagram shows transitions from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\", \"_Exit\", and \"Rebound\". None of these represent a \"steal\". Therefore, the number of steals after UMD Offense cannot be determined from the diagram.",
  "full_response": "Here's my analysis of the node-link diagram to determine the number of steals after UMD Offense:\n\n1.  **Relevant Elements:** The diagram shows events as nodes and transitions between them as links. The question asks about \"steals\" occurring after \"UMD Offense\". However, the diagram does not explicitly mention \"steals\" as an event. It only shows nodes like \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Rebound\", \"Foul\", and \"_Exit\".\n\n2.  **Thought Process:**\n    <reasoning>\n    The question asks about the number of steals after UMD Offense.
