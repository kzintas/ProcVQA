Examine the incoming links to each 'Discharge-Alive' node:\n    - The first 'Discharge-Alive' node has one incoming link from 'Emergency' with a count of 37.\n    - The second 'Discharge-Alive' node has one incoming link from 'ICU' with a count of 20.\n3. Sum the counts of all incoming links to 'Discharge-Alive' nodes: 37 + 20 = 57.\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 57.",
