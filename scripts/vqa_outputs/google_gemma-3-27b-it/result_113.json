  "question": "How many total Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links:** The question asks about \"Rebounds\" originating from \"UMD Offense\". We need to focus on the \"UMD Offense\" node and the link connecting it to the \"Rebound\" node.\n2. **Extract Value:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label \"34\". This indicates that 34 sequences pass through this link.\n3. **Interpret Value:** Since the link represents the transition from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\", the value \"34\" represents the number of times a Rebound occurred after \"UMD Offense\".",
