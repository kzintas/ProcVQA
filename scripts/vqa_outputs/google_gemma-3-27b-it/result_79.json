  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive.\n1. Identify the 'Discharge-Alive' node. There are three 'Discharge-Alive' nodes in the diagram.\n2. Determine the number of sequences leading to each 'Discharge-Alive' node:\n    - The first 'Discharge-Alive' node has a link from 'Emergency' with a count of 37.\n    - The second 'Discharge-Alive' node has a link from 'ICU' with a count of 20.\n    - The third 'Discharge-Alive' node has a link from 'Floor' with a count of 27.\n3. Sum the counts of all paths leading to 'Discharge-Alive' nodes: 37 + 20 + 27 = 84.",
