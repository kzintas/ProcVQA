  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "7",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about free throws made by UMD Offense. I need to identify nodes representing \"Made Shot\" events that are reached through pathways originating from \"UMD Offense\". \n\n1.  **Identify UMD Offense nodes:** There are three \"UMD Offense\" nodes in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace pathways from UMD Offense:**\n    *   The first \"UMD Offense\" node (26 sequences) leads to \"Missed Shot\" (18 sequences) and then to \"_Exit\" (18 sequences).\n    *   The second \"UMD Offense\" node (17 sequences) leads to \"Rebound\" (15 sequences) and then to \"Made Shot\" (7 sequences) and then to \"_Exit\" (7 sequences).\n    *   The third \"UMD Offense\" node (11 sequences) leads to \"_Exit\" (11 sequences).\n3.  **Identify \"Made Shot\" nodes:** There is one \"Made Shot\" node reachable from a \"UMD Offense\" node. This node has a value of 7.\n4.  **Determine the number of free throws:** Since \"Made Shot\" represents a successful shot, and the diagram doesn't differentiate between types of shots, we assume this includes free throws. The number of sequences leading to this \"Made Shot\" node from \"UMD Offense\" is 7.\n\nTherefore, 7 free throws were made by UMD Offense.",
