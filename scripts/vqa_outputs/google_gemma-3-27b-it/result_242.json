We need to find all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and sum the incoming link counts to those nodes.\n2. **Trace pathways to \"Missed Shot\" nodes:**\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node directly after \"Jump Ball\" with an incoming link count of 2.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node after \"Rebound\" with an incoming link count of 14.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node after \"UMD Offense\" with an incoming link count of 8.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node after \"UMD Offense\" with an incoming link count of 6.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node after \"Made Shot\" with an incoming link count of 17.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node after \"Made Shot\" with an incoming link count of 12.\n3. **Sum the incoming link counts:** 2 + 14 + 8 + 6 + 17 + 12 = 59",
