  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "19",
  "llm_answer": "2",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question focuses on \"Missed Shot\" nodes that appear in sequences originating from \"UNC Offense\" and leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace pathways:** We need to find all paths starting from \"UNC Offense\" that include one or more \"Missed Shot\" nodes and eventually reach \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Count missed shots:** For each relevant pathway, we count the number of \"Missed Shot\" nodes. Then, we sum these counts across all pathways.\n4. **Path 1:** _Start -> UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense. This path contains two \"Missed Shot\" nodes. The link from UNC Offense to Missed Shot has a value of 19, and the link from Missed Shot to Rebound has a value of 19. The link from Rebound to Missed Shot has a value of 15. The link from Missed Shot to UMD Offense has a value of 18.\n5. **Path 2:** _Start -> UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense. This path does not contain any \"Missed Shot\" nodes.\n6. **Total:** The total number of missed shots occurring after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is 2 (from Path 1).",
