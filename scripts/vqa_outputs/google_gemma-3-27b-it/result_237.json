  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and paths:** I need to trace paths originating from \"UNC Offense\" nodes that lead to \"Made Shot\" nodes, and then confirm that these paths do *not* involve any UMD offense nodes.\n2. **Trace paths from UNC Offense:**\n    - From the first \"UNC Offense\" node (at the very left), there's a path to \"Jump Ball\" (2 sequences), then to \"Missed Shot\" (2 sequences). There is also a path to \"Made Shot\" (2 sequences) and then to \"_Exit\" (2 sequences).\n    - From the second \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Rebound\" (19 sequences). From \"Rebound\", there's a path to \"Missed Shot\" (19 sequences). There is also a path to \"Made Shot\" (2 sequences) and then to \"_Exit\" (2 sequences).\n    - From the third \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Foul\" (12 sequences).\n    - From the fourth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Turnover\" (5 sequences). There is also a path to \"Made Shot\" (20 sequences) and then to \"UMD Offense\" (25 sequences).\n    - From the fifth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Made Shot\" (28 sequences) and then to \"_Exit\" (28 sequences).\n3. **Identify UNC-only Made Shots:**\n    - The first \"Made Shot\" node is reached from the first \"UNC Offense\" node with 2 sequences. This path does not involve UMD.\n    - The second \"Made Shot\" node is reached from the second \"UNC Offense\" node with 2 sequences. This path does not involve UMD.\n    - The third \"Made Shot\" node is reached from the fourth \"UNC Offense\" node with 20 sequences. This path involves UMD.\n    - The fourth \"Made Shot\" node is reached from the fifth \"UNC Offense\" node with 28 sequences. This path does not involve UMD.\n4. **Calculate the total:** Add the number of sequences for the UNC-only \"Made Shot\" nodes: 2 + 2 + 28 = 32.",
