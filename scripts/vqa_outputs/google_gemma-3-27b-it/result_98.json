  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to focus on the 'Floor' node and the link(s) connecting it to the 'ICU' node.\n2. **Locate the 'Floor' node:** There is one 'Floor' node in the rightmost column.\n3. **Trace the outgoing link(s) from 'Floor':** The 'Floor' node has one outgoing link to the 'ICU' node.\n4. **Read the link label:** The link connecting 'Floor' to 'ICU' is labeled with the number '24'. This indicates that 24 sequences went from 'Floor' to 'ICU'.\n5. **Interpret the link label:** Since each sequence represents a patient, this means 24 patients went to the ICU after being on the Floor.",
