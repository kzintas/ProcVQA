  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound. This means we need to find the number of sequences that went from UMD Offense to something other than Rebound.\n\n1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The relevant nodes are \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\". The link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of \"34\", and the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" has a label of \"35\".\n2. **Calculate the total number of sequences from UMD Offense:** The total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" is the sum of the values on the outgoing links: 34 + 35 = 69.\n3. **Determine the number of sequences that did *not* go to Rebound:** This is the number of sequences that went to \"_Exit\", which is 35.",
