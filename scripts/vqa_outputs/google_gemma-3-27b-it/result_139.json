  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question focuses on UMD Offense and its outgoing transitions. We need to consider the links originating from \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Analyze outgoing links:** From \"UMD Offense\", there are three outgoing links:\n    - To \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n    - To \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n    - To \"_Exit\" with a count of 21.\n3. **Calculate transitions not leading to Rebound:** We need to sum the counts of the links that *do not* lead to \"Rebound\". These are the links to \"Missed Shot\" and \"_Exit\".\n    - Missed Shot: 14\n    - _Exit: 21\n    - Total: 14 + 21 = 35",
