  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "19",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"missed shots\" between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". I need to trace pathways originating from \"UNC Offense\" and identify how many times \"Missed Shot\" appears on those paths before reaching \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace pathways from UNC Offense:**\n    - From the first \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Jump Ball\" (2 sequences), then to \"Missed Shot\" (2 sequences).\n    - From the second \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Rebound\" (19 sequences), then to \"Missed Shot\" (19 sequences).\n    - From the third \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Foul\" (12 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n    - From the fourth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Turnover\" (5 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n    - From the fifth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Made Shot\" (20 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n    - From the sixth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"UMD Offense\" (25 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Count missed shots:**\n    - The first path has 2 missed shots.\n    - The second path has 19 missed shots.\n4. **Calculate the total:** 2 + 19 = 21",
