Therefore, we need to focus on the link connecting these two nodes.\n2. **Locate the Link:**  The diagram shows a directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Read the Link Value:** The link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a numeric label of \"24\". This value represents the number of sequences that followed this path.\n4. **Interpret the Value:** The value \"24\" indicates that there were 24 sequences where the game transitioned from UNC Offense to UMD Offense.",
