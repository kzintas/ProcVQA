  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *after* going to the \"Floor\" node. We need to trace the paths originating from the \"Floor\" node that lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a label of \"24\". This indicates that 24 sequences (patients) went from the \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. **Calculate the total:** Since there is only one path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 24.",
