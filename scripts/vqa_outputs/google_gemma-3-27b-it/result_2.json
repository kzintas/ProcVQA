  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *directly* after arriving at Emergency. This means we need to focus on the \"Arrival\" node, the \"Emergency\" node, and the link connecting them that leads to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. **Trace the pathway:** We look for the link going from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" via \"Emergency\".\n3. **Read the link value:** The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of \"38\". This indicates that 38 sequences follow this path.",
