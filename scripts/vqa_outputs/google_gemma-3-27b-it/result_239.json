  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to focus on the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace pathways:** Starting from \"UNC Offense\", we need to follow the paths to see how many times \"Missed Shot\" appears before reaching \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Path 1:** UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense. This path contains two \"Missed Shot\" events. The link from UNC Offense to Missed Shot has a value of 2, and the link from Missed Shot to Rebound has a value of 14.\n4. **Path 2:** UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> Made Free Throw -> UMD Offense. This path contains one \"Missed Shot\" event. The link from UNC Offense to Rebound has a value of 14, and the link from Rebound to Missed Shot has a value of 14.\n5. **Path 3:** UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense. This path contains one \"Missed Shot\" event. The link from UNC Offense to Rebound has a value of 12, and the link from Rebound to Missed Shot has a value of 14.\n6. **Sum the occurrences:** Adding the number of \"Missed Shot\" events from each path: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.",
