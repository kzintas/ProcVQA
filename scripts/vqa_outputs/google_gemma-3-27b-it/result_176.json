  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links:** The question asks about the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the link connecting these two nodes.\n2. **Locate the Path:**  There is a direct link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\", and then from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Determine the Count:** The link between \"Made Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" has a label of \"22\". This indicates that 22 sequences followed this path.\n4. **Consider the Initial Link:** The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Made Shot\" has a label of \"23\". This indicates that 23 sequences followed this path.\n5. **Calculate the Transition Count:** Since the transition from UNC Offense to UMD Offense happens *through* \"Made Shot\", the number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense is the minimum of the two link counts. However, the question asks for the number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, which is the number of sequences that went from UNC Offense to Made Shot and then to UMD Offense. Therefore, the answer is 22.",
