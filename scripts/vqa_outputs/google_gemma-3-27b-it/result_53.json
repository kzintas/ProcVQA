  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. Therefore, we need to trace the paths originating from the \"Emergency\" node that eventually lead to the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" with a value of 41. From \"ICU\" there is a link to \"Die\" with a value of 36.\n3. **Calculate the number of sequences:** The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has 41 sequences, and the link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has 36 sequences. The number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the number of sequences that follow the path Emergency -> ICU -> Die. This is given by the minimum of the two link values, which is 36.",
