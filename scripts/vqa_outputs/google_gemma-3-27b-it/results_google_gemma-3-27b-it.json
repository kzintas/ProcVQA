    "is_correct": true,
    "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. Therefore, I need to trace the paths starting from the \"Emergency\" node that eventually lead to the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"Die\" with a value of 36. This indicates that 36 sequences go directly from Emergency to Die.\n3. **Consider other paths:** There is also a path from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" to \"Die\" with link values 21, 41, and 36 respectively. This indicates that 21 sequences go from Emergency to Floor, 41 sequences go from Floor to ICU, and 36 sequences go from ICU to Die.\n4. **Calculate the total:** To find the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, I need to sum the sequences along all paths leading to \"Die\" from \"Emergency\". This is 36 (direct path) + (21 * 41 * 36) which is not possible to calculate without knowing the exact number of sequences. However, the question asks for the number of patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency, and the diagram shows the number of sequences following each path. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of the sequences along all paths leading to \"Die\" from \"Emergency\".\n5. **Sum the sequences:** The total number of sequences leading to \"Die\" from \"Emergency\" is 36 + (21 * 41 * 36) = 36 + 30888 = 30924. However, the link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and the numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of the sequences along all paths leading to \"Die\" from \"Emergency\".\n6. **Final Calculation:** The total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36 + (21 * 36) = 36 + 756 = 792. However, the link from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" has a value of 41, so the correct calculation is 36 + (21 * 41 * 36) = 36 + 30888 = 30924.\n7. **Re-evaluate:** The question asks for the number of patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. The diagram shows that 36 patients went directly from Emergency to Die, and 21 patients went from Emergency to Floor, then 41 from Floor to ICU, and finally 36 from ICU to Die.

I need to trace pathways originating from \"UNC Offense\" and identify how many times \"Missed Shot\" appears on those paths before reaching \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace pathways from UNC Offense:**\n    - From the first \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Jump Ball\" (2 sequences), then to \"Missed Shot\" (2 sequences).\n    - From the second \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Rebound\" (19 sequences), then to \"Missed Shot\" (19 sequences).\n    - From the third \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Foul\" (12 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n    - From the fourth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Turnover\" (5 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n    - From the fifth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"Made Shot\" (20 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n    - From the sixth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a path to \"UMD Offense\" (25 sequences). This path does not lead to a \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Count missed shots:**\n    - The first path has 2 missed shots.\n    - The second path has 19 missed shots.\n4. **Calculate the total:** 2 + 19 = 21\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>21</answer>",

    "full_response": "Here's an analysis of the node-link diagram to determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense:\n\n<reasoning>\n1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"free throws made by UMD Offense\". We need to find the nodes representing \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\", and the links connecting them.\n2. **Trace the path:** There are two paths originating from \"UMD Offense\" that lead to \"Made Free Throw\".\n3. **Count the sequences:** The first path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\" has a link with a label \"10\". The second path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\" has a link with a label \"6\".\n4. **Calculate the total:** To find the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we add the sequence counts from both paths: 10 + 6 = 16.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>16</answer>",

    "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to trace pathways originating from \"UNC Offense\" nodes that lead to \"Made Shot\" nodes, and ensure these pathways do *not* involve \"UMD Offense\" before the \"Made Shot\" node.\n2. **Trace pathways:**\n    - Starting from the first \"UNC Offense\" node (top left), there's a link to \"Jump Ball\" (2 sequences). This doesn't lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n    - From the first \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a link to \"Missed Shot\" (2 sequences). This doesn't lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n    - From the second \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a link to \"Rebound\" (14 sequences). This leads to \"Missed Shot\" (14 sequences) and doesn't lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n    - From the third \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a link to \"Rebound\" (12 sequences). This leads to \"Made Free Throw\" (6 sequences) and \"Missed Shot\" (6 sequences).\n    - From the fourth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a link to \"Steal\" (6 sequences). This leads to \"UMD Offense\" (10 sequences) and then to \"Made Shot\" (3 sequences). This pathway involves UMD offense, so it doesn't count.\n    - From the fifth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a link to \"Missed Shot\" (9 sequences). This doesn't lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n    - From the sixth \"UNC Offense\" node, there's a link to \"Made Shot\" (17 sequences). This is a direct path from UNC Offense to Made Shot.\n3. **Count the relevant \"Made Shot\" sequences:** The only direct path from UNC Offense to Made Shot is the one with 17 sequences.\n4. **Consider other paths:** The path from \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Free Throw\" -> \"Made Shot\" (7 sequences) is also a path where UNC offense makes a shot.\n5. **Total:** 17 + 7 = 24",
