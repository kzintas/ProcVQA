  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question focuses on the \"UMD Offense\" node and its outgoing links. We need to find the total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" and subtract the number of sequences that lead to \"Rebound\".\n2. **Total sequences from UMD Offense:** The outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" have the following counts: 34 (to Rebound), 14 (to Missed Shot), 10 (to Foul), and 8 (to Made Shot). The total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" is 34 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 66.\n3. **Sequences from UMD Offense to Rebound:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of 34.\n4. **Sequences from UMD Offense not to Rebound:** To find the number of sequences that did *not* transition to \"Rebound\", subtract the number of sequences to \"Rebound\" from the total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\": 66 - 34 = 32.",
