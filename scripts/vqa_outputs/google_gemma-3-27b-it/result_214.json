  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes:** The question asks about \"missed shots\". We need to find all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and sum the values associated with the incoming links to those nodes.\n2. **Trace pathways to \"Missed Shot\" nodes:**\n    - The first \"Missed Shot\" node has an incoming link from \"_Start\" with a value of 7.\n    - The second \"Missed Shot\" node has an incoming link from \"Rebound\" with a value of 14.\n    - The third \"Missed Shot\" node has an incoming link from \"Rebound\" with a value of 6.\n    - The fourth \"Missed Shot\" node has an incoming link from \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 7.\n    - The fifth \"Missed Shot\" node has an incoming link from \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 12.\n3. **Sum the values:** 7 + 14 + 6 + 7 + 12 = 46",
