  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"made shots\" between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the path connecting these nodes through \"Made Shot\".\n2. **Trace the path:** The diagram shows a link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" with a value of 22. Then, there is a link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 22.\n3. **Determine the count:** The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Made Shot\" has a label of 22, indicating that 22 sequences went from UNC Offense to Made Shot. The link between \"Made Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" has a label of 22, indicating that 22 sequences went from Made Shot to UMD Offense.\n4. **Answer the question:** The question asks for the number of made shots *after* UNC Offense and *before* UMD Offense. This corresponds to the number of sequences that went from UNC Offense to Made Shot, which is 22.",
