We need to find all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and sum their associated counts.\n2. **Locate \"Missed Shot\" nodes:** There are three \"Missed Shot\" nodes in the diagram.\n3. **Extract counts:**\n    - The first \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 7.\n    - The second \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 14.\n    - The third \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 15.\n4. **Calculate the total:** Add the counts from all \"Missed Shot\" nodes: 7 + 14 + 15 = 36.",
