  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. Therefore, I need to trace the paths originating from the \"Emergency\" node that lead to the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\", and then from \"ICU\" to \"Die\". The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a label of \"62\", indicating that 62 sequences follow this path. The link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has a label of \"36\", indicating that 36 sequences follow this path.\n3. **Determine the number of patients:** Since the link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has 62 sequences and the link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has 36 sequences, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
