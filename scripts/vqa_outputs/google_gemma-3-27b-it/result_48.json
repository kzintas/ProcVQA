  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. I need to identify all pathways that end with \"Discharge-Alive\" and sum the number of sequences that follow those paths.\n\n1.  **Path 1:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive. The number of sequences following the link from Emergency to Discharge-Alive is 38.\n2.  **Path 2:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The number of sequences following the link from Floor to Discharge-Alive is 24.\n3.  **Path 3:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The number of sequences following the link from Floor to Discharge-Alive is 24.\n\nNow, I sum the number of sequences for each path: 38 + 24 + 24 = 86.",
