There are two \"Floor\" nodes in the diagram.\n3. **Trace the outgoing links from \"Floor\":** From the \"Floor\" node on the left, there is a link to \"ICU\" with a label of \"23\". From the \"Floor\" node on the right, there is a link to \"ICU\" with a label of \"24\".\n4. **Sum the counts:** Add the counts on the links going from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\": 23 + 24 = 47.",
