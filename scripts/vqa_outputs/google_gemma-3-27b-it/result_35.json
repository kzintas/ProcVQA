  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. Therefore, we need to trace the paths starting from the \"Emergency\" node that eventually lead to the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is one path from \"Emergency\" to \"Die\". This path goes from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" (21 sequences), then from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" (21 sequences), and finally from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" (36 sequences).\n3. **Determine the number of sequences:** The link between \"ICU\" and \"Die\" has a label of \"36\". This indicates that 36 sequences followed this path. Since this is the only path from \"Emergency\" to \"Die\", the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
