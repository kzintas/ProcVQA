  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense. In the diagram, \"Foul\" represents a free throw opportunity for UMD Offense. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" has a label of \"10\", indicating that 10 sequences led to a foul. The link from \"Foul\" to \"_Exit\" has a label of \"10\", indicating that 10 sequences ended after a foul. Since a foul leads to a free throw attempt, and the diagram shows 10 sequences leading to a foul, we can assume that 10 free throws were made by UMD Offense.",
