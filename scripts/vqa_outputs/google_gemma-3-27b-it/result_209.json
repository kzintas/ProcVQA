  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to trace pathways originating from \"UNC Offense\" nodes that lead to \"Made Shot\" nodes, and ensure these pathways do not involve \"UMD Offense\" before the \"Made Shot\".\n2. **Trace pathways:**\n    - Starting from the top \"Start\" node with a value of 7, it leads to \"UNC Offense\" (7). From \"UNC Offense\", there's a link to \"Made Shot\" (21). This pathway represents sequences where UNC Offense directly leads to a Made Shot.\n    - From the second \"Start\" node with a value of 14, it leads to \"UNC Offense\" (14). From \"UNC Offense\", there's a link to \"Made Shot\" (21). This pathway represents sequences where UNC Offense directly leads to a Made Shot.\n    - From the third \"Start\" node with a value of 15, it leads to \"UNC Offense\" (15). From \"UNC Offense\", there's a link to \"Made Shot\" (21). This pathway represents sequences where UNC Offense directly leads to a Made Shot.\n    - From the fourth \"Start\" node with a value of 25, it leads to \"UNC Offense\" (25). From \"UNC Offense\", there's a link to \"Made Shot\" (21). This pathway represents sequences where UNC Offense directly leads to a Made Shot.\n3. **Calculate the total:** The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a value of 21. This means there are 21 sequences where UNC Offense leads to a Made Shot.\n4. **Verify exclusivity:** The diagram shows no pathways where \"UMD Offense\" occurs *before* a \"Made Shot\" originating from a \"UNC Offense\" node. Therefore, all 21 made shots are attributable to the UNC offense.",
