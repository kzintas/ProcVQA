  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to focus on the 'Floor' node and the 'Discharge-Alive' node, and the link connecting them.\n2. **Trace the pathway:** The diagram shows a link from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n3. **Read the link label:** The link between 'Floor' and 'Discharge-Alive' is labeled with the number '23'. This indicates that 23 sequences of patients went from the 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n4. **Interpret the link label:** Since each sequence represents a patient pathway, the link label '23' means 23 patients were discharged alive after being on the Floor.",
