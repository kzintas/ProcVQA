  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *directly* after an Emergency. This means we need to focus on the \"Emergency\" node and the link directly connecting it to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n2. **Extract the link value:** The link connecting \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a numeric label of \"38\".\n3. **Interpret the link value:** The link width and numeric label represent the number of sequences (patients in this context) that followed that path. Therefore, 38 patients were discharged alive directly after an Emergency.",
