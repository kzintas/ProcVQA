  "true_answer": "8",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about fouls occurring between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the link(s) originating from \"UNC Offense\" that lead to \"Foul\" and then check if \"Foul\" has a link to \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace the path:** From \"UNC Offense\", there is a link to \"Foul\" with a value of 8.\n3. **Check for connection to UMD Offense:** From \"Foul\", there is a link to \"_Exit\" with a value of 7. There is no direct link from \"Foul\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n4. **Determine the number of sequences:** The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Foul\" has a value of 8, indicating that 8 sequences followed this path.",
