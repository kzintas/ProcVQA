  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"missed shots\" and \"UMD Offense\". I need to locate these nodes in the diagram and trace the path leading from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Count the sequences:** The link between \"Missed Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" has a label \"24\". This indicates that there are 24 sequences that follow this path.\n4. **Answer the question:** The question asks how many missed shots were *before* UMD Offense. The diagram shows that 24 sequences went from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, there were 24 missed shots before UMD Offense.",
