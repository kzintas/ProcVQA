  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about rebounds *after* UMD Offense. So, we need to focus on the \"UMD Offense\" node and the links originating from it that lead to \"Rebound\".\n2. **Trace the path:** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there is a link to \"Rebound\" with a label of \"27\".\n3. **Interpret the link label:** The link label \"27\" indicates the number of sequences that follow that path. Therefore, 27 sequences went from UMD Offense to Rebound.",
