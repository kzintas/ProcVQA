We need to find all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\".\n2. **Locate \"Made Shot\" nodes:** There are two \"Made Shot\" nodes in the diagram.\n3. **Determine the counts associated with each \"Made Shot\" node:**\n    - The first \"Made Shot\" node has a value of 20 associated with the incoming link from \"UMD Offense\".\n    - The second \"Made Shot\" node has a value of 2 associated with the incoming link from \"UNC Offense\".\n4. **Calculate the total:** Add the values associated with each \"Made Shot\" node: 20 + 2 = 22.",
