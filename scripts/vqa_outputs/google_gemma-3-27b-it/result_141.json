  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made *directly after* a Rebound. This means we need to focus on the \"Rebound\" node and the link connecting it to the \"Made Shot\" node.\n2. **Examine the link label:** The link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a label of \"15\". This label represents the number of sequences that follow that path.\n3. **Interpret the label:** Since the link directly connects \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", the label \"15\" indicates that there were 15 sequences where a shot was made immediately after a rebound.",
