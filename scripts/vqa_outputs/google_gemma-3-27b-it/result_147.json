  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question focuses on the \"UMD Offense\" node and its outgoing links. We need to consider the link to \"Rebound\" and the link to \"_Exit\".\n2. **Determine the number of sequences from UMD Offense to Rebound:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of \"34\". This means 34 sequences went from UMD Offense to Rebound.\n3. **Determine the number of sequences from UMD Offense to _Exit:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" has a label of \"35\". This means 35 sequences went from UMD Offense to _Exit.\n4. **Calculate the number of times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound:** This is equivalent to the number of sequences that went from UMD Offense to \"_Exit\", which is 35.",
