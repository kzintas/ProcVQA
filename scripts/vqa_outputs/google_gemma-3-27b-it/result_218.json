  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "25",
  "llm_answer": "28",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to focus on the paths originating from \"UNC Offense\" and leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace pathways:**\n    - From \"UNC Offense\", there's a path to \"Jump Ball\" (1 sequence) and \"Missed Shot\" (2 sequences).\n    - The \"Missed Shot\" node has a link to \"Rebound\" (25 sequences).\n    - From \"Rebound\", there's a link to \"Made Shot\" (26 sequences) and \"Missed Shot\" (26 sequences).\n    - The second \"Missed Shot\" node has a link to \"Rebound\" (25 sequences).\n    - From \"Rebound\", there's a link to \"UMD Offense\" (20 sequences).\n3. **Count missed shots:** We need to count the number of times \"Missed Shot\" appears on the paths between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n    - The first \"Missed Shot\" occurs 2 times directly after \"UNC Offense\".\n    - The second \"Missed Shot\" occurs 26 times after the first \"Rebound\".\n4. **Calculate the total:** 2 + 26 = 28",
