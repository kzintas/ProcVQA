The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\", going through \"UNC Offense\", then \"UMD Offense\", and branching into \"Rebound\" and \"Missed Shot\", ultimately leading to \"_Exit\". The numbers on the links represent the number of sequences following each path. There is no information about fouls within this diagram.",
