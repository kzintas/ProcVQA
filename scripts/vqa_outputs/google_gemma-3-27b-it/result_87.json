  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes:** We need to focus on the \"Emergency\" node and the \"Discharge-Alive_Exit\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** Look for a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive_Exit\".\n3. **Count the sequences:** The link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive_Exit\" has a label \"37\". This indicates that 37 sequences follow this path.\n4. **Interpret the result:** Since the link width represents the number of sequences and the label confirms it, 37 patients were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
