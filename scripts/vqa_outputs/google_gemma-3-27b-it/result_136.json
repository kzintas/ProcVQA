  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of free throws made by UMD Offense. However, the diagram does not explicitly mention \"free throws\". It only shows events like \"Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\". \n\nThe diagram shows that UMD Offense leads to two possible outcomes: \"Rebound\" (34 sequences) and \"Missed Shot\" (14 + 21 = 35 sequences). The \"Rebound\" node then leads to \"Made Shot\" (15 sequences) and \"_Exit\" (19 sequences). The \"Made Shot\" node leads to \"_Exit\" (15 sequences). The \"Missed Shot\" node leads to \"_Exit\" (14 sequences).\n\nSince the diagram does not explicitly state that \"Made Shot\" represents a free throw, or any other type of shot, we cannot determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.",
