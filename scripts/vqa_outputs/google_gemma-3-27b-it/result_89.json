There are two \"ICU\" nodes.\n3. **Trace the outgoing links from \"ICU\":** From the first \"ICU\" node (left side), there is a link to \"Floor\" with a label of \"23\". From the second \"ICU\" node (right side), there is a link to \"Floor\" with a label of \"27\".\n4. **Sum the counts:** Add the counts on the links going from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\": 23 + 27 = 50.",
