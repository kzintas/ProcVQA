I need to trace all paths leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and sum the corresponding link counts.\n\n1.  **Path 1:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive. The link between Emergency and Discharge-Alive has a count of 38.\n2.  **Path 2:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The link between Floor and Discharge-Alive has a count of 21.\n3.  **Path 3:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The link between Floor and Discharge-Alive has a count of 8.\n4.  **Path 4:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> ICU -> Discharge-Alive.
