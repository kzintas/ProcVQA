  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"free throws made by UMD Offense\". We need to find the nodes representing \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\", and the links connecting them.\n2. **Trace the path:** There are two paths originating from \"UMD Offense\" that lead to \"Made Free Throw\".\n3. **Count the sequences:** The first path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\" has a link with a label \"10\". The second path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\" has a link with a label \"6\".\n4. **Calculate the total:** To find the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we add the sequence counts from both paths: 10 + 6 = 16.",
