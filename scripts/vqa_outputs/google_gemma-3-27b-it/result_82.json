  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "27",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about the path from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\".\n2. **Trace the path:** There are two instances of the ICU node in the diagram.\n    - The first ICU node (left side) does not have a link to the Floor.\n    - The second ICU node (right side) has a link to the Floor.\n3. **Determine the count:** The link from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" has a label of \"27\". This indicates that 27 sequences followed this path.\n4. **Final Answer:** Therefore, 27 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
