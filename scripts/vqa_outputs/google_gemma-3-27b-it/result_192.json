  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"missed shots\" and \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the node labeled \"Missed Shot\" and the node labeled \"UMD Offense\", and the link connecting them.\n2. **Trace the path:** The diagram shows a link going from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Read the link value:** The link connecting \"Missed Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" has a label \"24\". This indicates that there are 24 sequences that follow this path.\n4. **Answer the question:** The question asks how many missed shots were *before* UMD Offense. The link value of 24 directly represents the number of sequences where a missed shot occurred before UMD Offense.",
