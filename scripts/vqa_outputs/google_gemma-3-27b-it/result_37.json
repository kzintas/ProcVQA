  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *directly* after an Emergency visit. This means we need to focus on the \"Emergency\" node and the link directly connecting it to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n2. **Extract the link value:** The link connecting \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a numeric label of \"38\". This value represents the number of sequences (patients) that followed this specific path.\n3. **Interpret the value:** Since the link is direct and represents the path from Emergency to Discharge-Alive, the value \"38\" directly answers the question.",
