  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links:** The question asks about \"Made Shot\" nodes occurring between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace Pathways:** We need to find pathways that start at \"UNC Offense\", go through a \"Made Shot\" node, and then lead to \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Count Sequences:** The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Made Shot\" has a label of \"22\". This indicates that 22 sequences follow this path.\n4. **Confirm Path Completion:** The link between \"Made Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" has a label of \"22\". This confirms that all 22 sequences that went from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" continued to \"UMD Offense\".\n5. **Final Count:** Therefore, there are 22 made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD offense.",
