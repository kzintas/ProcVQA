  "question": "How many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency? ",
  "true_answer": "37",
  "llm_answer": "37",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes:** We need to focus on the \"Start_Arrival\", \"Emergency\", and \"Discharge-Alive_Exit\" nodes.\n2. **Trace the pathway:** We are looking for the direct path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive_Exit\".\n3. **Examine link values:** There are multiple \"Start_Arrival\" nodes. We need to find the link connecting \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive_Exit\" originating from the \"Start_Arrival\" node with the value 37. The link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive_Exit\" has a label of \"37\".\n4. **Interpret the link value:** The link value \"37\" indicates that 37 sequences follow this path.",
