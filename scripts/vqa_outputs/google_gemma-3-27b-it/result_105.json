  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about the path from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\".\n2. **Locate the \"Floor\" node:** Find the node labeled \"Floor\" in the diagram. There are two \"Floor\" nodes.\n3. **Trace the outgoing links from \"Floor\":** From the \"Floor\" node on the right side of the diagram, there is a link going to \"ICU\".\n4. **Determine the link width/count:** The link from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" has a numeric label of \"24\". This indicates that 24 sequences followed this path.\n5. **Interpret the count:** Since each sequence represents a patient, 24 patients went to the ICU after the Floor.",
