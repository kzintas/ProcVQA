  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about the path from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\". We need to examine the link connecting these two nodes.\n2. **Extract the link value:** The link connecting \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" has a numeric label of \"24\".\n3. **Interpret the link value:** The link width and numeric label represent the number of sequences (patients in this context) that followed that path. Therefore, 24 patients went from the ICU to the Floor.",
