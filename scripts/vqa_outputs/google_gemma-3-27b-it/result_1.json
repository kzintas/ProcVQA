  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. We need to trace all paths leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and sum the sequence counts along those paths.\n\n1.  **Path 1:** Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive. The sequence count along this path is 100 (Start to Arrival) * 38 (Emergency to Discharge-Alive) = 38.\n2.  **Path 2:** Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The sequence count along this path is 100 (Start to Arrival) * 62 (Emergency to ICU) * 24 (ICU to Floor) * 24 (Floor to Discharge-Alive) = 24 * 62 * 24 = 35712.\n3.  **Path 3:** Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Die -> _Exit. This path does not lead to Discharge-Alive, so it is not relevant.\n4.  **Path 4:** Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> _Exit. This path does not lead to Discharge-Alive, so it is not relevant.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of the sequence counts from the relevant paths: 38 + 24 = 62.",
