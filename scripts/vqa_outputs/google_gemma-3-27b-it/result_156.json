  "question": "How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about shots missed *immediately* after UMD Offense. In the diagram, UMD Offense has two outgoing links. One leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34, and the other leads to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.  The \"Rebound\" node represents a missed shot, as it indicates the ball was not directly scored after the offense. The \"_Exit\" node represents the end of a sequence, which could be a made or missed shot. However, the question specifically asks about missed shots, so we only consider the path leading to \"Rebound\". The link from UMD Offense to Rebound has a value of 34, which represents the number of sequences following that path. Therefore, 34 shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense.",
