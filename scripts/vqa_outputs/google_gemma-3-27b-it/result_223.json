  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "32",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to trace pathways originating from \"_Start\" nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" that lead to \"Made Shot\" nodes and then to \"_Exit\" nodes, without passing through \"UMD Offense\" nodes in between.\n2. **Trace pathways:**\n    - Starting from the first \"_Start\" node labeled \"UNC Offense\" (with a value of 2), there's a link to \"Jump Ball\" (1) and \"Missed Shot\" (2). Neither of these leads to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n    - Starting from the second \"_Start\" node labeled \"UNC Offense\" (with a value of 13), there's a link to \"Foul\" (13). This does not lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n    - Starting from the third \"_Start\" node labeled \"UNC Offense\" (with a value of 26), there's a link to \"Rebound\" (26). This does not lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n    - Starting from the fourth \"_Start\" node labeled \"UNC Offense\" (with a value of 21), there's a link to \"Turnover\" (4). This does not lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n    - Starting from the fifth \"_Start\" node labeled \"UNC Offense\" (with a value of 7), there's a link to \"UMD Offense\" (4). This path involves the UMD offense, so it doesn't count.\n3. **Identify \"Made Shot\" nodes connected to UNC Offense:** There is a \"Made Shot\" node connected to \"Rebound\" (20 sequences). However, this \"Rebound\" is connected to \"UNC Offense\" (26 sequences). There is also a \"Made Shot\" node connected to \"Made Free Throw\" (12 sequences). This \"Made Free Throw\" is connected to \"Foul\" (13 sequences) which is connected to \"UNC Offense\" (13 sequences).\n4. **Calculate the total:** The \"Made Shot\" node connected to \"Rebound\" has 20 sequences. The \"Made Shot\" node connected to \"Made Free Throw\" has 12 sequences. Therefore, the total number of shots made by only the UNC offense is 20 + 12 = 32.",
