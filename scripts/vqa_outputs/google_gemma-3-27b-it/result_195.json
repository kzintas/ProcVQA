  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of steals *after* UMD Offense. However, the diagram does not contain a node labeled \"Steal\". The diagram shows the following nodes and connections: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\". After \"UMD Offense\", there are two outgoing links: one to \"Rebound\" with a value of 34, and one to \"_Exit\" with a value of 22. Since \"Steal\" is not a node in the diagram, we cannot determine the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense.",
