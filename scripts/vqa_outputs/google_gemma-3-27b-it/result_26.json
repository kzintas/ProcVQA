  "question": "How many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency? ",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *directly* after arriving at Emergency. This means we need to focus on the \"Arrival\" node, the \"Emergency\" node, and the link connecting them to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n2. **Trace the pathway:** We are looking for the direct path from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. **Determine the count:** The link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of \"38\". This indicates that 38 sequences follow this path.\n4. **Confirm direct path:** The question specifies *directly* after arriving at Emergency. The diagram shows that 38 patients went from Emergency to Discharge-Alive without any intermediate steps.",
