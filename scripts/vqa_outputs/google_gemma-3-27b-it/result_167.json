  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "4",
  "llm_answer": "4",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about steals occurring *after* \"UMD Offense\". I need to find the \"UMD Offense\" node and trace the paths originating from it to see if any lead to a \"Steal\" node.\n2. **Trace pathways from UMD Offense:** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there is a link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 16, a link to \"_Exit\" with a count of 8, and a link to \"Foul\" with a count of 27.\n3. **Check for Steal node:** The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" leads to \"_Exit\". The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" leads to \"Rebound\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Turnover\", and \"_Exit\". None of these paths lead to a \"Steal\" node. However, there is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Steal\" with a count of 4.\n4. **Determine the count:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Steal\" has a label of \"4\". This indicates that 4 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" directly to \"Steal\".",
