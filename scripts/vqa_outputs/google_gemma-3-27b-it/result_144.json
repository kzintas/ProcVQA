  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of free throws made by UMD Offense. The diagram shows that UMD Offense leads to two possible outcomes: \"Rebound\" and \"Missed Shot\". The \"Rebound\" node then leads to \"Made Shot\" and \"\\_Exit\". The \"Made Shot\" node then leads to \"\\_Exit\". The number of sequences that follow the path UMD Offense -> Rebound -> Made Shot is 15. Since \"Made Shot\" represents a successful shot, and the question asks about free throws, we assume \"Made Shot\" represents free throws. Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 15.",
  "full_response": "Here's my analysis of the node-link diagram to determine the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense:\n\n1.  **Relevant Elements:** The diagram shows the following nodes and links: \\_Start, UNC Offense, UMD Offense, Rebound, Made Shot, Missed Shot, \\_Exit. The links connecting these nodes have numeric labels indicating the number of sequences following each path.\n2.  **Thought Process:**\n    <reasoning>\n    The question asks about the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.
