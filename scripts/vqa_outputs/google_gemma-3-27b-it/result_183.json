  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links:** The question asks about the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the link connecting these two nodes.\n2. **Locate the Path:**  There is a direct link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" with a value of 22. Then there is a link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 22.\n3. **Determine the Count:** The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a label of 22, and the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a label of 22. This means that 22 sequences went from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" and then to \"UMD Offense\".",
