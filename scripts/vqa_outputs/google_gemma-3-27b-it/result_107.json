  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. We need to identify all pathways that end with the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and sum the number of sequences that follow those paths.\n\n1.  **First Pathway:** \"Start\\_Arrival\" -> \"Emergency\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\". The link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of \"37\".\n2.  **Second Pathway:** \"Start\\_Arrival\" -> \"ICU\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\". The link between \"ICU\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of \"12\".\n3.  **Third Pathway:** \"Start\\_Arrival\" -> \"Emergency\" -> \"ICU\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\". The link between \"ICU\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of \"23\".\n4.  **Fourth Pathway:** \"Start\\_Arrival\" -> \"Floor\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\". The link between \"Floor\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of \"20\".\n\nNow, we sum the counts from each pathway: 37 + 12 + 23 + 20 = 92",
