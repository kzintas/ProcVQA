  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes:** The question asks about \"missed shots\". We need to find all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and sum the number of sequences that lead to them.\n2. **Trace pathways to \"Missed Shot\" nodes:**\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected to \"Jump Ball\" with a link value of 2.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected to \"UNC Offense\" (from the second \"_Start\" node) with a link value of 19.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected to \"Rebound\" with a link value of 19.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected to \"Made Shot\" with a link value of 28.\n    - There's a \"Missed Shot\" node connected to \"UMD Offense\" with a link value of 18.\n3. **Sum the values:** Add the link values associated with each \"Missed Shot\" node: 2 + 19 + 19 + 28 + 18 = 86",
