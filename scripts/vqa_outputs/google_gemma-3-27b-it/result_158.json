  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows the flow of events starting from \"_Start\", going through \"UNC Offense\", then \"UMD Offense\", and finally branching into \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\". The question asks for the total shots made by the UMD offense. \n\nThe UMD offense node has two outgoing links: one to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34, and another to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35. The \"_Exit\" node represents the end of a sequence, which in this context means a shot was taken. Therefore, the total number of shots made by the UMD offense is the sum of the sequences leading to \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\".\n\nTotal shots = Sequences to \"Rebound\" + Sequences to \"_Exit\" = 34 + 35 = 69.",
