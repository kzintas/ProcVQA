  "question": "How many Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"Rebounds\" following \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the node labeled \"Rebound\" and the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a directed link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n3. **Read the link value:** The link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a numeric label of \"34\". This indicates that 34 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n4. **Interpret the value:** Since \"Rebound\" represents the event of a rebound, the value \"34\" represents the number of rebounds made by UMD Offense.",
