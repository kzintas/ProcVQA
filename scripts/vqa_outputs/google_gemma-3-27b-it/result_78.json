  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to trace the paths starting from the \"Emergency\" node and ending at the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Path 1:** Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Die. The link between Emergency and Die has a label of 12. This indicates 12 patients followed this path.\n3. **Path 2:** Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Die. The link between Emergency and ICU has a label of 37. The link between ICU and Die has a label of 24. The number of patients following this path is 37 * 24 = 888. However, the diagram shows that the link between Emergency and ICU has a width that is proportional to the number of sequences following that path. The link between ICU and Die has a width that is proportional to the number of sequences following that path. The link between Emergency and ICU has a label of 37, and the link between ICU and Die has a label of 24. Therefore, the number of patients following this path is 37 * 24 = 888.\n4. **Path 3:** Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die. The link between Emergency and Floor has a label of 27. The link between Floor and ICU has a label of 27. The link between ICU and Die has a label of 18. Therefore, the number of patients following this path is 27 * 27 * 18 = 13122.\n5. **Total Deaths after Emergency:** Add the number of patients from each path: 12 + 24 + 18 = 54.\n6. **Total Deaths after Emergency:** Add the number of patients from each path: 12 + (37 * 24) + (27 * 27 * 18) = 12 + 888 + 13122 = 14022.\n7. **Consider the diagram's structure:** The diagram shows multiple \"Start\" nodes, each leading to \"Arrival\" and then \"Emergency\". This suggests that the counts represent the total number of patients across all starting points.\n8. **Sum the counts leading to \"Die\" after \"Emergency\":**\n    - Emergency -> Die: 12\n    - Emergency -> ICU -> Die: 37 * 24 = 888\n    - Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die: 27 * 27 * 18 = 13122\n    - Total: 12 + 888 + 13122 = 14022",
