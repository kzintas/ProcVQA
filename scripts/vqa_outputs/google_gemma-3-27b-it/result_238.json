  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to find the \"UNC Offense\" node and any links leading from it to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n2. **Trace pathways:**  There is a link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\".\n3. **Count sequences:** The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Jump Ball\" has a label of \"1\". This indicates that there was 1 sequence that followed this path.",
