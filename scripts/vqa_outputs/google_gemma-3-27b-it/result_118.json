  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made by the UMD offense. We need to focus on the \"UMD Offense\" node and the links leading from it to nodes representing \"Made Shot\" events.\n2. **Trace pathways:** There is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" with a label of 3. There is also a path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" to \"Made Shot\" with a label of 14.\n3. **Calculate the total:** Add the number of sequences following each path: 3 + 14 = 17.",
