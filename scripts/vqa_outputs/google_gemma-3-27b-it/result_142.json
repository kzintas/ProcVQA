  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "510",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made by the UMD offense. The relevant nodes are \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"Made Shot\". The links connecting these nodes are crucial.\n2. **Trace the pathway:** We need to follow the path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot\".\n3. **Count sequences:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of \"34\". This means 34 sequences go from UMD Offense to Rebound. The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a label of \"15\". This means 15 sequences go from Rebound to Made Shot.\n4. **Calculate total shots made:** To find the total number of shots made by UMD offense, we multiply the number of sequences along the path: 34 * 15 = 510.",
