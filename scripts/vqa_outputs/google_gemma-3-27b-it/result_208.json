  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to find the nodes representing \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\", and the links connecting them.\n2. **Trace pathways:** There are two pathways leading from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\".\n3. **Count sequences:**\n    - The first pathway goes from \"UMD Offense\" (node with 13 sequences entering) to \"Made Free Throw\" (node with 13 sequences entering). The link between them has a label of \"13\".\n    - The second pathway goes from \"UMD Offense\" (node with 8 sequences entering) to \"Made Free Throw\" (node with 8 sequences entering). The link between them has a label of \"8\".\n4. **Calculate total:** Add the number of sequences along both pathways: 13 + 8 = 21.",
