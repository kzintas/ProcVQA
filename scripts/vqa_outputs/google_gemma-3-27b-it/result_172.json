  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two \"Rebound\" nodes.\nThe first \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"UNC Offense\" with a link labeled \"8\". This indicates 8 sequences lead to a rebound after \"UNC Offense\".\nThe second \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"_Exit\" with a link labeled \"24\". This indicates 24 sequences lead to a rebound after \"_Exit\".\nTo find the total number of rebounds, we need to sum the counts on the links leading to the \"Rebound\" nodes: 8 + 24 = 32.",
