  "question": "How many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency? ",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *directly* after arriving at Emergency. This means we need to focus on the \"Arrival\" node, the \"Emergency\" node, and the link connecting them that leads to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. **Examine the link:** The link between \"Arrival\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is labeled with the number \"38\". This indicates that 38 sequences go directly from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. **Confirm direct path:** The diagram shows no intermediate nodes between \"Arrival\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" on this path. Therefore, these 38 sequences represent patients discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
