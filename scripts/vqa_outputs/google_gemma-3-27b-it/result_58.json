  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *after* going to the Floor. This means we need to focus on the \"Floor\" node and the paths leading from it to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. **Trace pathways:** There are two pathways originating from the \"Floor\" node.\n    - The first pathway goes from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a link weight of 24.\n    - The second pathway goes from \"Floor\" to \"Die\" and then to \"_Exit\". This pathway does not lead to \"Discharge-Alive\", so it is irrelevant to the question.\n3. **Sum the counts:** The only pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Floor\" has a count of 24.\n4. **Total:** Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 24.",
