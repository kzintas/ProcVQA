  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of rebounds made by both teams. I need to identify all nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and sum the values associated with the incoming links to those nodes.\n\n1.  **First Rebound Node:** The first \"Rebound\" node has an incoming link from \"Missed Shot\" with a value of 14.\n2.  **Second Rebound Node:** The second \"Rebound\" node has an incoming link from \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 7.\n3.  **Third Rebound Node:** The third \"Rebound\" node has an incoming link from \"Missed Shot\" with a value of 11.\n4.  **Fourth Rebound Node:** The fourth \"Rebound\" node has an incoming link from \"Made Shot\" with a value of 18.\n\nNow, I sum these values: 14 + 7 + 11 + 18 = 50",
