We need to find the \"Foul\" node and the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\".\n2. **Locate the UMD Offense to Foul link:** The diagram shows a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" with a label \"10\".\n3. **Interpret the link label:** The link label \"10\" indicates that there are 10 sequences that go from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\". Since each sequence represents a foul, this means 10 fouls were made by UMD Offense.",
