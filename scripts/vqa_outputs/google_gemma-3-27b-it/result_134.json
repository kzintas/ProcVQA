  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made by the UMD offense. The relevant nodes are \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", \"Made Shot\", and \"_Exit\". The links connecting these nodes are crucial.\n2. **Trace pathways from UMD Offense to Made Shot:** We need to find all paths originating from \"UMD Offense\" that eventually lead to \"Made Shot\".\n3. **Path 1: UMD Offense -> Rebound -> Made Shot:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a value of 34. The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a value of 15. This means 15 sequences followed this path.\n4. **Calculate total shots made:** Since the only path from UMD offense to a made shot is through the rebound, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is 15.",
