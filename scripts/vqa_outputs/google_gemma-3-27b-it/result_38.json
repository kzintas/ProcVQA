  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about the flow from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\". We need to find the link connecting these two nodes.\n2. **Extract the count:** The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a label \"21\". This indicates that 21 sequences went from Emergency to ICU.\n3. **Consider other paths:** There is another path from Emergency to Floor, and then to ICU with a count of 41 and 24 respectively. So, the total number of patients who went to ICU after Emergency is 21 + 41 + 24 = 86.",
