  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "12",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"free throws made by UMD Offense\". I need to find the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" and trace the paths leading from it to a node labeled \"Made Free Throw\".\n2. **Trace the path:** Starting from the \"UMD Offense\" node, there is a link to \"Foul\" with a count of 3. From \"Foul\", there is a link to \"Made Free Throw\" with a count of 12.\n3. **Determine the count:** The link from \"Foul\" to \"Made Free Throw\" has a label of \"12\". This indicates that 12 sequences went from \"Foul\" to \"Made Free Throw\". Since the \"Foul\" event originates from \"UMD Offense\", this means 12 free throws were made by UMD Offense.",
