Trace the paths leading to each 'Discharge-Alive' node:\n    - The first 'Discharge-Alive' node is reached from 'Emergency' with a link count of 37.\n    - The second 'Discharge-Alive' node is reached from 'Floor' with a link count of 20.\n3. Sum the counts on the links leading to 'Discharge-Alive' nodes: 37 + 20 = 57.",
