  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two \"Rebound\" nodes.\nThe first \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"UNC Offense\" with a link labeled \"15\" and to \"Missed Shot\" with a link labeled \"9\". This indicates there are 15 + 9 = 24 rebounds originating from these paths.\nThe second \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"UMD Offense\" with a link labeled \"7\" and to \"Missed Shot\" with a link labeled \"6\". This indicates there are 7 + 6 = 13 rebounds originating from these paths.\nTherefore, the total number of rebounds is 24 + 13 = 37.",
