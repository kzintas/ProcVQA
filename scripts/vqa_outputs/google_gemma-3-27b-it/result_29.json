  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. Therefore, I need to focus on the 'Emergency' node and the path leading to the 'Die' node.\n2. **Trace the pathway:** There is a link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU', and from 'ICU' to 'Die'.\n3. **Determine the sequence count:** The link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' has a label of '62', indicating 62 sequences followed this path. The link from 'ICU' to 'Die' has a label of '36', indicating 36 sequences followed this path.\n4. **Calculate the number of patients who died:** Since the path is 'Emergency' -> 'ICU' -> 'Die', the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the number of sequences that followed this entire path, which is 36.",
