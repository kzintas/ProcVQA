  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows the flow of events in a match. I need to find the number of times the \"Rebound\" node is reached.\n1. The \"Rebound\" node is reached from the \"UMD Offense\" node via a link with a value of 34. This means there are 34 sequences that lead to a rebound.\n2. The \"Rebound\" node then leads to the \"_Exit\" node with a value of 24. This indicates that 24 sequences end after a rebound.\n3. The question asks for the *total* number of rebounds, which is the number of times the \"Rebound\" node is reached. This is directly given by the link value from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\", which is 34.",
