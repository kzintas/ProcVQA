  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made *directly after* a Rebound. This means we need to focus on the \"Rebound\" node and the links originating from it.\n2. **Examine links from \"Rebound\":** There is only one link originating from the \"Rebound\" node, and it leads to \"_Exit\". The link has a label of \"34\".\n3. **Interpret the link label:** The link label \"34\" represents the number of sequences that follow that path. Since the path from \"Rebound\" leads to \"_Exit\", this means 34 sequences went from Rebound to Exit.\n4. **Determine if \"_Exit\" represents a shot:** Based on the diagram, \"_Exit\" represents the end of a sequence. Therefore, the 34 sequences represent shots made after a rebound.",
