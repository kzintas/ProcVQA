It contains nodes labeled \"_Start\", \"Arrival\", \"Emergency\", \"ICU\", \"Die\", \"_Exit\", \"Discharge-Alive\". The question seems to be referring to the \"Emergency\" node as the \"Floor\". \n\nThe diagram shows that 38 sequences go from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". Therefore, 38 patients were discharged alive after going to the Emergency department.",
