  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. This means we need to trace paths starting from the \"Emergency\" node that eventually lead to the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" with a value of 62. From \"ICU\" there is a link to \"Die\" with a value of 36.\n3. **Calculate the number of patients:** The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" represents 62 sequences, and the link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" represents 36 sequences. Therefore, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
