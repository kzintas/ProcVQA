  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows the flow of patients through a system, starting from \"_Start\" and ending at either \"_Exit\" (representing death) or \"_Exit\" (representing discharge). The question asks for the number of patients discharged alive.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant nodes and links:** The relevant nodes are \"Discharge-Alive\" and \"_Exit\" (representing discharge). The link connecting \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label \"38\". This indicates that 38 sequences of events lead from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2.  **Determine the total number of discharged alive patients:** Since the link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a value of 38, this means 38 patients were discharged alive.",
