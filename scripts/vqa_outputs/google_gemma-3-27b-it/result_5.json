  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *after* going to the Floor. This means we need to focus on the \"Floor\" node and the outgoing links from it.\n2. **Trace the path:** From the \"Floor\" node, there is a link to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a label of \"24\". This indicates that 24 sequences went from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. **Consider other paths:** There is also a link from \"Floor\" to \"_Exit\" with a label of \"24\". However, the question specifically asks about patients discharged *alive*, so we only consider the path to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4. **Total count:** The link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of 24. Therefore, 24 patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor.",
