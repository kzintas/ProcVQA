  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "18",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made by the UMD offense. I need to focus on the \"UMD Offense\" node and the paths leading from it to nodes representing \"Made Shot\".\n2. **Trace pathways:** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there is a link to \"Made Shot\" with a label of 3. This indicates 3 sequences where the UMD offense directly leads to a made shot.\n3. **Consider indirect paths:** There is also a path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" (34 sequences) and then from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" (15 sequences). This means 15 sequences where UMD offense leads to a rebound and then a made shot.\n4. **Calculate the total:** Add the number of sequences for each path leading to a \"Made Shot\": 3 + 15 = 18.",
