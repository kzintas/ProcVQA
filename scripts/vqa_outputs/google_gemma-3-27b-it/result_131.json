  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "14",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question focuses on the \"UMD Offense\" node and its outgoing links. We need to consider the links leading to \"Rebound\" and those leading elsewhere.\n2. **Count sequences to Rebound:** The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of \"34\". This means 34 sequences went from UMD Offense to Rebound.\n3. **Count total sequences from UMD Offense:** The \"UMD Offense\" node has two outgoing links: one to \"Rebound\" (34 sequences) and one to \"Missed Shot\" (14 sequences). The total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" is 34 + 14 = 48.\n4. **Calculate sequences not to Rebound:** To find the number of times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound, subtract the number of sequences to Rebound from the total number of sequences from UMD Offense: 48 - 34 = 14.",
