  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. I need to identify all paths that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and sum the number of sequences along those paths.\n\n1.  **Path 1:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The number of sequences along this path is 100 -> 100 -> 21 -> 38. So, 38 patients were discharged alive through this path.\n2.  **Path 2:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Discharge-Alive. The number of sequences along this path is 100 -> 100 -> 41 -> 38. So, 38 patients were discharged alive through this path.\n3.  **Path 3:** \\_Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Floor -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The number of sequences along this path is 100 -> 100 -> 21 -> 24 -> 24. So, 24 patients were discharged alive through this path.\n\nNow, I sum the number of patients discharged alive from each path: 38 + 38 + 24 = 100.",
