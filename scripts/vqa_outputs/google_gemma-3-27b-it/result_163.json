  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "4",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links:** The question asks about events between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". We need to trace paths originating from \"UNC Offense\" and leading to \"UMD Offense\", and count the \"Made Shot\" nodes along those paths.\n2. **Trace Pathways:**\n    - From \"UNC Offense\", there's a link to \"Rebound\" (23 sequences). From \"Rebound\", there's a link to \"Made Shot\" (4 sequences). This path leads to \"UMD Offense\".\n    - From \"UNC Offense\", there's a link to \"Made Free Throw\" (8 sequences). From \"Made Free Throw\", there's a link to \"UMD Offense\" (27 sequences).\n    - From \"UNC Offense\", there's a link to \"Foul\" (5 sequences). From \"Foul\", there's a link to \"UMD Offense\" (27 sequences).\n3. **Count \"Made Shot\" Nodes:** Only one pathway contains a \"Made Shot\" node: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"Made Shot\". The link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" has a value of 4, indicating 4 sequences follow this path.",
