We need to find the node labeled \"Missed Shot\" and the link connecting it to \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace the path:**  There is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\".\n3. **Read the link value:** The link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a label of \"14\". This indicates that 14 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\".\n4. **Interpret the value:** Since the question asks for the number of missed shots *immediately* after UMD Offense, the link value directly answers the question.",
