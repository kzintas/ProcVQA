  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "3",
  "llm_answer": "14",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"free throws made by UMD Offense\". We need to find the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" and trace the paths leading from it to the node labeled \"Made Free Throw\".\n2. **Trace the path:** Starting from \"UMD Offense\", there is a link to \"Made Free Throw\" with a label of \"3\". This indicates that 3 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\".\n3. **Consider other paths:** There is another path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\" with a label of \"11\". This indicates that 11 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\".\n4. **Calculate the total:** Add the number of sequences along all paths from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\": 3 + 11 = 14.",
