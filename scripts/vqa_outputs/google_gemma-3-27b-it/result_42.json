  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients discharged alive, so I need to focus on the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and the paths leading to it.\n2. **Trace pathways to \"Discharge-Alive\":**\n    - There's a direct path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a link value of 38. This means 38 patients went directly from Emergency to Discharge-Alive.\n    - There's a path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a link value of 24. This means 24 patients went from Floor to Discharge-Alive.\n3. **Calculate the total:** To find the total number of patients discharged alive, I need to add the number of patients following each path to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node: 38 + 24 = 62.",
