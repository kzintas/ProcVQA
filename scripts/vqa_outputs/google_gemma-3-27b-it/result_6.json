  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. Therefore, we need to trace the paths originating from the \"Emergency\" node that lead to the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" with a value of 62. From \"ICU\" there is a link to \"Die\" with a value of 36.\n3. **Calculate the number of patients:** The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" represents 62 sequences, and the link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" represents 36 sequences. This means 36 patients went from Emergency to ICU and then died.",
