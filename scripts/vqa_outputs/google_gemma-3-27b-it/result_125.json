  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made *directly after* a Rebound. This means we need to focus on the \"Rebound\" node and the link(s) leading *from* it to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" with a label of \"15\".\n3. **Interpret the link label:** The link label \"15\" indicates the number of sequences that follow that path. Therefore, 15 sequences went from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n4. **Answer the question:** The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a rebound, which is represented by the link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\".",
