  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about shots made *directly after* a Rebound. This means we need to focus on the \"Rebound\" node and the links that originate from it and lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" with a label of \"15\". This indicates that 15 sequences follow this path.\n3. **Confirm direct connection:** The link directly connects \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" without any intermediate nodes.\n4. **Extract the count:** The label on the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is \"15\". This represents the number of sequences where a shot was made directly after a rebound.",
