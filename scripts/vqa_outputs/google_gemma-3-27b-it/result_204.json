  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to focus on the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace pathways:** Starting from \"UNC Offense\", we need to follow the paths to see how many lead to \"Missed Shot\" before eventually reaching \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Path 1:** UNC Offense (7) -> Missed Shot (7). This path does not lead to UMD Offense.\n4. **Path 2:** UNC Offense (14) -> Missed Shot (14). This path does not lead to UMD Offense.\n5. **Path 3:** UNC Offense (4) -> Rebound (1) -> UMD Offense (2). This path does not include a missed shot.\n6. **Path 4:** UNC Offense (4) -> Turnover (2). This path does not include a missed shot.\n7. **Path 5:** UNC Offense (15) -> Foul (15) -> UMD Offense (23). This path does not include a missed shot.\n8. **Path 6:** UNC Offense (15) -> Made Shot (21) -> UMD Offense (23). This path does not include a missed shot.\n9. **Path 7:** UNC Offense (4) -> Jump Ball (1). This path does not include a missed shot.\n10. **Path 8:** UNC Offense (7) -> Missed Shot (7) -> Rebound (7) -> UMD Offense (7). This path includes one missed shot.\n11. **Path 9:** UNC Offense (14) -> Missed Shot (14) -> Rebound (14) -> UMD Offense (13). This path includes one missed shot.\n12. **Path 10:** UNC Offense (4) -> Rebound (4) -> Missed Shot (6) -> Rebound (11) -> Made Shot (7) -> Exit (7). This path includes one missed shot, but does not lead to UMD Offense.\n13. **Path 11:** UNC Offense (4) -> _Exit (4). This path does not include a missed shot.\n\nBased on the diagram, there are two paths that include a missed shot between UNC Offense and UMD Offense. The first path has a count of 7, and the second path has a count of 14. Therefore, the total number of missed shots is 7 + 14 = 21.",
