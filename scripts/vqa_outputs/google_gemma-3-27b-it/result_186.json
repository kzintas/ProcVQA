  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two \"Rebound\" nodes.\n1. The first \"Rebound\" node is reached from \"UNC Offense\" with a link value of 15. This indicates 15 sequences lead to a rebound after UNC offense.\n2. The second \"Rebound\" node is reached from \"UMD Offense\" with a link value of 34. This indicates 34 sequences lead to a rebound after UMD offense.\nTo find the total number of rebounds, I need to sum the values of the links leading to the \"Rebound\" nodes: 15 + 34 = 49.",
