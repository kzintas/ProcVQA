  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about the path from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\".\n2. **Locate the \"ICU\" node:** Find the \"ICU\" node in the diagram. There are two \"ICU\" nodes.\n3. **Trace the outgoing links from \"ICU\":** From the first \"ICU\" node (with 23 sequences), there is a link to \"Floor\" with a label of 23. From the second \"ICU\" node (with 24 sequences), there is a link to \"Die\" with a label of 18.\n4. **Determine the number of sequences:** The link from the first \"ICU\" node to \"Floor\" has a label of 23, indicating that 23 sequences followed this path.\n5. **Final Calculation:** Therefore, 23 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
