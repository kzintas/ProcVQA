  "question": "How many fouls were made after UNC Offense and before UMD offense? ",
  "true_answer": "8",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to focus on the path starting from \"UNC Offense\" and leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n2. **Trace the path:** From \"UNC Offense\", there are three outgoing links:\n    - UNC Offense -> Rebound (23 sequences)\n    - UNC Offense -> Made Shot (4 sequences)\n    - UNC Offense -> Foul (8 sequences)\n3. **Follow the \"Foul\" path:** The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Foul\" has a count of 8. This means 8 sequences went through this path.\n4. **Examine the node following \"Foul\":** The \"Foul\" node connects to \"UMD Offense\" with a link of 27 sequences.\n5. **Calculate the total:** The question asks for the number of fouls made *after* UNC Offense and *before* UMD Offense. The diagram shows a direct link from UNC Offense to Foul with a count of 8.",
