  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "27",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question focuses on \"UMD Offense\" and its transitions. We need to find all paths originating from \"UMD Offense\" and subtract the paths that lead to \"Rebound\".\n2. **Total paths from UMD Offense:** From \"UMD Offense\", there are three outgoing links:\n    - To \"Rebound\" with a count of 34\n    - To \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14\n    - To \"Foul\" with a count of 10\n    - To \"Made Shot\" with a count of 3\n    The total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" is 34 + 14 + 10 + 3 = 61.\n3. **Paths *not* leading to Rebound:**  We need to sum the counts of all paths from \"UMD Offense\" that *do not* lead to \"Rebound\". These are the paths to \"Missed Shot\" (14), \"Foul\" (10), and \"Made Shot\" (3).\n    So, 14 + 10 + 3 = 27.",
