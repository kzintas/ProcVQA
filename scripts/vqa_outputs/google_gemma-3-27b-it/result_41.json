  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. This means we need to trace the paths starting from the \"Arrival\" node, going through \"Emergency\", and ending at the \"Die\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:**\n    - From \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\", there are 100 sequences.\n    - From \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\", there are 21 sequences.\n    - From \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", there are 38 sequences.\n    - From \"Floor\" to \"ICU\", there are 41 sequences.\n    - From \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", there are 21 sequences.\n    - From \"ICU\" to \"Die\", there are 36 sequences.\n    - From \"ICU\" to \"Floor\", there are 24 sequences.\n    - From \"Die\" to \"_Exit\", there are 36 sequences.\n    - From \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\", there are 38 sequences.\n    - From \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", there are 24 sequences.\n    - From \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\", there are 24 sequences.\n3. **Calculate the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency:** We need to find the number of sequences that go from \"Arrival\" -> \"Emergency\" -> \"Die\". The path is: Arrival (100) -> Emergency (21) -> Floor (41) -> ICU (36) -> Die (36). The number of sequences following this path is determined by the minimum value along the path. The minimum value is 36.",
