  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to find the \"UNC Offense\" node and then trace the links leading from it to the \"Jump Ball\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** Starting from the \"UNC Offense\" node at the top left, there is a link to \"Jump Ball\".\n3. **Determine the count:** The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Jump Ball\" has a label of \"1\". This indicates that the sequence of events \"UNC Offense\" followed by \"Jump Ball\" occurred once.",
