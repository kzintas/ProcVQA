  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"missed shots\" before \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the \"Missed Shot\" node and the links pointing *to* the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n2. **Trace pathways:**  There is a direct link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 24. This indicates that 24 sequences went from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Determine the answer:** The diagram shows that 24 sequences led from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, there were 24 missed shots before UMD Offense.",
