  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a Rebound. In the diagram, 'Rebound' is a node, and the link originating from 'Rebound' leads to '_Exit'. The label on this link indicates the number of sequences following this path. The label next to the link from 'Rebound' to '_Exit' is '34'. Therefore, 34 sequences went from 'Rebound' to '_Exit'. Since '_Exit' represents a shot being made, this means 34 shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
