  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links:** The question focuses on the sequence: UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense.\n2. **Trace the Pathway:** We need to find the link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" and the link connecting \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n3. **Extract Counts:** The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a label of \"22\". The link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a label of \"22\".\n4. **Determine the Number of Sequences:** The number of sequences following the path UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense is determined by the minimum value of the links in the path. In this case, both links have a value of 22.\n5. **Answer the Question:** The question asks for the number of made shots *after* UNC Offense and *before* UMD Offense. This corresponds to the number of sequences following the path UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense, which is 22.",
