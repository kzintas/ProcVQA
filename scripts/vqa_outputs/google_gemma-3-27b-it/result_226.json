  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two distinct rebound events: one associated with UNC and one with UMD.\n1. **UNC Rebound:** The link from 'Missed Shot' to 'Rebound' (UNC) has a value of 19. This indicates 19 sequences led to a rebound for UNC.\n2. **UMD Rebound:** The link from 'Missed Shot' to 'Rebound' (UMD) has a value of 15. This indicates 15 sequences led to a rebound for UMD.\nTo find the total number of rebounds, I will add the number of rebounds for UNC and UMD: 19 + 15 = 34.",
