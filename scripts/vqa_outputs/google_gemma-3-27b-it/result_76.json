  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to trace the path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. **Trace the path:** There is a direct link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. **Determine the count:** The link between \"Floor\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of \"23\". This indicates that 23 sequences followed this path.\n4. **Interpret the count:** Since each sequence represents a patient, 23 patients were discharged alive after being on the Floor.",
