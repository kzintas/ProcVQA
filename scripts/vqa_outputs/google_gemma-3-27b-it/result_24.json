  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at the Emergency department. Therefore, we need to trace the path from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" and then to \"Die\".\n2. **Trace the pathway:**\n    - There is a link from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" with a value of 100, indicating 100 patients went from Arrival to Emergency.\n    - From \"Emergency\", there is a link to \"ICU\" with a value of 62.\n    - From \"ICU\", there is a link to \"Die\" with a value of 36.\n3. **Calculate the number of patients:** The number of patients who went from Arrival to Emergency to ICU to Die is determined by the smallest link value along that path. In this case, it's 36.",
