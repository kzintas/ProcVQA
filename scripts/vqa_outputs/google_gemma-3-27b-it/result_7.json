  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. I need to identify all pathways that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and sum the number of sequences along those paths.\n\n1.  **Path 1:** From \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". The link connecting these nodes has a label of \"38\". This means 38 sequences followed this path.\n2.  **Path 2:** From \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". The link connecting these nodes has a label of \"24\". This means 24 sequences followed this path.\n\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, I add the number of sequences from both paths: 38 + 24 = 62.",
