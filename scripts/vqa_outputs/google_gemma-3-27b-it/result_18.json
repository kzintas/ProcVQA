  "reasoning": "I need to find the number of sequences that go from 'Arrival' to 'Emergency' and then to 'Die'.\n    The link from 'Arrival' to 'Emergency' has a count of 100.\n    From 'Emergency', there are two outgoing links: one to 'ICU' with a count of 62, and one to 'Discharge-Alive' with a count of 38.\n    From 'ICU', there are two outgoing links: one to 'Die' with a count of 36, and one to 'Floor' with a count of 24.\n    Therefore, the number of patients who went from 'Arrival' to 'Emergency' to 'ICU' to 'Die' is 36.\n    There is no direct path from 'Emergency' to 'Die'.\n    Thus, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
