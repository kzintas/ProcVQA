  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "16",
  "llm_answer": "16",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about \"Fouls\" made by \"UMD Offense\". We need to trace the paths originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node that lead to the \"Foul\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** From \"UMD Offense\", there is a link to \"Foul\" with a label of \"10\". This indicates that 10 sequences went from UMD Offense directly to Foul.\n3. **Consider other paths:** There is also a path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" with a label of \"14\". From \"Missed Shot\" there is a path to \"Foul\" with a label of \"6\". This indicates that 6 sequences went from UMD Offense to Missed Shot to Foul.\n4. **Calculate the total:** To find the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense, we add the sequences from both paths: 10 + 6 = 16.",
