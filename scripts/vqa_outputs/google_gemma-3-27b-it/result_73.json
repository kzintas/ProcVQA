  "question": "How many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency? ",
  "true_answer": "37",
  "llm_answer": "37",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes:** We need to focus on the \"Arrival\" node connected to the \"Emergency\" node, and then trace the path to the \"Discharge_Alive\" node.\n2. **Trace the path:** Starting from the leftmost \"Start/Arrival\" node, we follow the link to \"Emergency\". From \"Emergency\", we look for a direct link to \"Discharge_Alive\".\n3. **Count the sequences:** The link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge_Alive\" has a label \"37\". This indicates that 37 sequences follow this path.\n4. **Consider other paths:** We need to ensure there are no other paths from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge_Alive\" via other nodes. The diagram shows that the only path from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge_Alive\" is through \"Emergency\".",
