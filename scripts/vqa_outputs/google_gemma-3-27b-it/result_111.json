  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "20",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify relevant nodes and links:** We need to find the pathway that includes \"Floor\" and leads to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. **Trace the pathway:** There is a link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a label of \"20\". This indicates that 20 sequences went from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. **Interpret the link label:** The number on the link represents the number of patients who followed that path. Therefore, 20 patients were discharged alive after being on the Floor.",
