1. From ""Emergency"" to ""Floor"":

2. From ""Floor"", there are two paths:
   a. ""Floor"" → ""ICU"" (21 patients)
   b. ""Floor"" → ""Discharge-Alive"" (20 patients, but this path is not shown; instead, all 41 go to ICU, so this path does not exist in the diagram)
   
3. From ""ICU"" (after ""Floor""):
   - 24 patients go from ""ICU"" to ""Floor"" (so these are patients who went ""Emergency"" → ""ICU"" → ""Floor"").
   - From this ""Floor"" (after ICU), 8 go to ""ICU"" again, and 16 go to ""Discharge-Alive"".
   - The 8 who go to ICU again, all 8 go to ""Discharge-Alive"".

4. Now, let's sum up all patients who were discharged alive after visiting ""Floor"":

To answer how many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor, I need to trace all pathways where a patient visits the ""Floor"" node at any point and is later discharged alive (""Discharge-Alive"").

1. From ""Emergency"" to ""Floor"":
   - 41 patients go from ""Emergency"" to ""Floor"".
2. From ""Floor"", there are two paths:
   a. ""Floor"" → ""ICU"" (21 patients)
   b. ""Floor"" → ""Discharge-Alive"" (20 patients, but this path is not shown; instead, all 41 go to ICU, so this path does not exist in the diagram)
   
3. From ""ICU"" (after ""Floor""):
   - 24 patients go from ""ICU"" to ""Floor"" (so these are patients who went ""Emergency"" → ""ICU"" → ""Floor"").
   - From this ""Floor"" (after ICU), 8 go to ""ICU"" again, and 16 go to ""Discharge-Alive"".
   - The 8 who go to ICU again, all 8 go to ""Discharge-Alive"".

4. Now, let's sum up all patients who were discharged alive after visiting ""Floor"":
   - ""Emergency"" → ""Floor"" → ""ICU"" → ""Floor"" → ""Discharge-Alive"": 16 patients
   - ""Emergency"" → ""Floor"" → ""ICU"" → ""Floor"" → ""ICU"" → ""Discharge-Alive"": 8 patients

Total = 16 + 8 = 24 patients

There is no direct path from ""Floor"" to ""Discharge-Alive"" in the diagram, so all discharges alive after ""Floor"" must come through the above two paths.

## Question 
How many total rebounds are there in the match?
    ","To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, I need to count every instance where a ""Rebound"" node is reached in the diagram, as each represents a rebound event.

1. From ""UNC Offense"":
   - ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"": 15 sequences
   - ""Rebound"" → ""UNC Offense"": 15 sequences (but this is a loop, not a new rebound event)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""UMD Offense"": 9 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Foul"": 5 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)

2. From ""UMD Offense"":
   - ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"": 27 sequences
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Foul"": 4 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Made Shot"": 7 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Missed Shot"": 6 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Turnover"": 4 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)

Now, let's sum up all unique instances where a ""Rebound"" node is reached:
- From UNC Offense: 15 (from Missed Shot)
- From UMD Offense: 27 (from Missed Shot)
- From UMD Offense's ""Rebound"" node: 4 (Foul) + 7 (Made Shot) + 6 (Missed Shot) + 4 (Turnover) = 21

However, the 21 rebounds after the first UMD Offense ""Rebound"" node are already included in the 27 rebounds from ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"" (since the 27 splits into these branches). So, we should not double-count them.

Similarly, for UNC Offense, after the first ""Rebound"" node, the 9 (to UMD Offense) and 5 (to Foul) are part of the 15 from ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"".

So, the total number of rebounds is:
- 15 (UNC Offense Missed Shot → Rebound)
- 23 (UNC Offense → Rebound, but this is after a made shot, so not a rebound event)
- 27 (UMD Offense Missed Shot → Rebound)

The ""Rebound"" node directly from ""UNC Offense"" with 23 sequences is not after a missed shot, so it is not a rebound event.

Therefore, the total number of rebounds is:
15 (from UNC Offense missed shots) + 27 (from UMD Offense missed shots) = 42",42,1391,623,2014,gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,200,"<reasoning>

- 27 (UMD Offense Missed Shot → Rebound)

The ""Rebound"" node directly from ""UNC Offense"" with 23 sequences is not after a missed shot, so it is not a rebound event.

The diagram shows two links: one to ""Rebound"" with a value of 24, and one to ""_Exit"" with a value of 22. The value on the link to ""Rebound"" directly represents the number of sequences (or times) a rebound occurred after ""UMD Offense.""

## Question 
How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?
    ","- We are asked for the total number of ""Missed Shot"" events that occur after ""UNC Offense"" but before ""UMD Offense.""
- We need to find all pathways where ""UNC Offense"" is followed by ""Missed Shot,"" and then, before reaching ""UMD Offense,"" count those ""Missed Shot"" events.

Let's examine each pathway:

### Pathway 1 (leftmost, 19 sequences):
- _Start (19) → UNC Offense (19) → Missed Shot (19) → Rebound (19) → UMD Offense (17)
- Here, all 19 sequences have a ""Missed Shot"" after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense.""
- So, 19 missed shots.

### Pathway 2 (middle, 33 sequences):
- _Start (33) → UNC Offense (33) → Missed Shot (18) → _Exit (33)
- _Start (33) → UNC Offense (33) → Made Shot (28) → UMD Offense (26)
- Only the first branch has ""Missed Shot"" after ""UNC Offense,"" but it does not reach ""UMD Offense"" after the missed shot (it goes to _Exit).
- So, 0 missed shots in this pathway that are between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense.""

- _Start (15) → UNC Offense (15) → Foul (15) → UMD Offense (11)
- No ""Missed Shot"" between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"" here.

### Pathway 4 (far left, 2 sequences):
- _Start (2) → UNC Offense (2) → Missed Shot (2) → _Exit (2)
- No ""UMD Offense"" after ""Missed Shot,"" so not counted.

### Summary:
- Only the first pathway (19 sequences) has ""Missed Shot"" after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense.""
- All other pathways either do not have a ""Missed Shot"" between these two events or do not reach ""UMD Offense"" after a ""Missed Shot.""",19,1058,541,1599,gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,200,"1. **Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer:**

## Question 
How many total missed shots were made by both teams?
    ","To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, I need to identify all nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"" and sum the counts on the links leading to or from these nodes.

- Middle-right ""Made Shot"": 17

Step 3: Add up all the made shots.
2 + 7 + 3 + 17 = 29

Step 4: Check for any other ""Made Shot"" nodes.
- No other ""Made Shot"" nodes are present in the diagram.

Step 5: Confirm that these represent both teams (since the diagram tracks all sequences and does not separate by team for ""Made Shot"" nodes).

## Question 
How many total missed shots were made by both teams?
    ","To find the total number of missed shots by both teams, I need to sum all the numeric values associated with the ""Missed Shot"" nodes throughout the diagram.

Step-by-step:
- In the first column, there is a ""Missed Shot"" node with a value of 2.
- In the second column, there is a ""Missed Shot"" node with a value of 14.
- In the fifth column, there is a ""Missed Shot"" node with a value of 9.
- In the sixth column, there is a ""Missed Shot"" node with a value of 6.
- In the seventh column, there are two ""Missed Shot"" nodes, one with a value of 12 and one with a value of 6.

Now, I will sum these values:
2 (first column) +
14 (second column) +
9 (fifth column) +
6 (sixth column) +
12 (seventh column) +
6 (seventh column) = 49

Therefore, the total number of missed shots made by both teams is 49.",49,1052,300,1352,gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,200,"1. Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer:
- The nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"" represent missed shots by both teams.
- The numeric labels next to the links leading from ""Missed Shot"" nodes indicate the count of sequences (missed shots) at each occurrence.

## Question 
How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?
    ","- Start by finding all ""Made Shot"" nodes and tracing their incoming links to see if they are made by the UNC offense without an intervening UMD possession.
- On the far left, from ""UNC Offense"" (2), after ""Jump Ball"" and ""Missed Shot"" (2), there is a ""Made Shot"" (2). This is directly after UNC Offense, so these 2 are by UNC.
- In the next pathway, ""UNC Offense"" (14) leads to ""Missed Shot"" (14), then ""Rebound"" (14), then ""UMD Offense"" (13), then ""Rebound"" (13), then ""Made Shot"" (7). These 7 are after a UMD possession, so not by UNC.
- In the next pathway, ""UNC Offense"" (12) leads to ""Rebound"" (5), ""Foul"" (9), ""Made Free Throw"" (10), ""Made Free Throw"" (6), then exit. No ""Made Shot"" here.
- In the next pathway, ""UNC Offense"" (14) leads to ""Steal"" (6), ""UMD Offense"" (10), ""Made Shot"" (3). These 3 are after UMD Offense, so not by UNC.
- In the next pathway, ""UNC Offense"" (9) leads to ""Missed Shot"" (9), ""UMD Offense"" (8), ""Made Shot"" (17). These 17 are after UMD Offense, so not by UNC.
- In the last pathway, ""UNC Offense"" (18) leads to ""Made Shot"" (17). This is directly after UNC Offense, so these 17 are by UNC.

Now sum the ""Made Shot"" counts that are directly after ""UNC Offense"" without an intervening UMD possession:
- 2 (first pathway)
- 17 (last pathway)

Total = 2 + 17 = 19",19,1052,514,1566,gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,200,"1. Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer:
- The nodes labeled ""UNC Offense"" and ""Made Shot"" are key.
- We are looking for sequences where a ""Made Shot"" occurs directly after ""UNC Offense"" and not after a change of possession (i.e., not after ""UMD Offense"").
- The link counts next to ""Made Shot"" nodes are crucial.
