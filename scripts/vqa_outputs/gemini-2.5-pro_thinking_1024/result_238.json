  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to find the number of sequences where the event \"Jump Ball\" directly follows the event \"UNC Offense\".\n\n2.  **Locate Relevant Nodes:** I will scan the diagram to find all nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" and \"Jump Ball\".\n\n3.  **Trace the Path:**\n    *   I start by looking for a \"UNC Offense\" node. I find one in the first column from the left. It has a count of 2.\n    *   Following the directed link downwards from this \"UNC Offense\" node, I see it splits into two paths.\n    *   One path leads directly to a node labeled \"Jump Ball\".\n    *   The other path leads to a node labeled \"Missed Shot\".\n\n4.  **Determine the Count:**\n    *   The numeric label next to the \"Jump Ball\" node indicates the number of sequences that followed this specific path.\n    *   The label next to the \"Jump Ball\" node is 1.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** This means that there was exactly 1 sequence where \"UNC Offense\" was immediately followed by a \"Jump Ball\". I scanned the rest of the diagram and found no other instances of this sequence.",
