  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I first identified the core question, which asks for the total number of free throws made by \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  I then carefully examined all the nodes and labels present in the provided node-link diagram.\n3.  The nodes in the diagram are: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, and `_Exit`.\n4.  The diagram shows sequences of these events. For example, all 69 sequences pass through the `UMD Offense` event. After `UMD Offense`, 34 sequences go to `Rebound` and 35 go to `_Exit`.\n5.  However, there is no node, link, or label in the diagram that mentions \"free throw\" or provides any information about what specific actions occurred during the `UMD Offense` event. The diagram only shows the sequence of high-level events, not the detailed actions within them.\n6.  Since the visualization does not contain any information about free throws, it is impossible to determine the answer from the provided data.",
