  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the number of patients who went to the ICU *after* being on the Floor. This corresponds to finding the pathway \"Floor\" -> \"ICU\" in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Locate 'Floor' Nodes:** I scan the diagram for nodes labeled \"Floor\". I find two such nodes:\n    *   In the third pathway from the left, there is a \"Floor\" node with a count of 23.\n    *   In the fourth pathway from the left, there is a \"Floor\" node with a count of 27.\n\n3.  **Trace Pathways from 'Floor' Nodes:**\n    *   **Pathway 3:** Following the link from the \"Floor\" node (count 23), the path leads to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. This path is not \"Floor -> ICU\".\n    *   **Pathway 4:** Following the link from the \"Floor\" node (count 27), the path leads directly to an \"ICU\" node. This is the relevant pathway.\n\n4.  **Determine the Count for the \"Floor -> ICU\" Pathway:**\n    *   The starting node for this specific transition is \"Floor\", which has a count of 27. This means 27 sequences (patients) reached this \"Floor\" event.\n    *   The destination node for this transition is \"ICU\", which has a count of 24. This means 24 sequences (patients) continued from the \"Floor\" to this \"ICU\" event.\n    *   The link connecting \"Floor\" (27) to \"ICU\" (24) represents the flow of patients between these two events. The number of sequences following this specific path is indicated by the count of the subsequent node, which is 24.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the diagram, 24 patients followed the sequence from the Floor to the ICU.",
