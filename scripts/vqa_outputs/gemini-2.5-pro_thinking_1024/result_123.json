  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify all outgoing links:** Find all the directed links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node. These links represent the events that followed a \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  **List the subsequent events and their frequencies:**\n    *   The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a value of 34.\n    *   The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a value of 14.\n    *   The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" has a value of 10.\n    *   The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a value of 8.\n    *   The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" has a value of 3.\n4.  **Calculate the total number of \"UMD Offense\" events:** Sum the values of all outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\": 34 + 14 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 69. This matches the incoming link value to \"UMD Offense\", confirming the total.\n5.  **Identify the transitions that are not to \"Rebound\":** These are the transitions to \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Made Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n6.  **Sum the frequencies of these non-Rebound transitions:** Add the counts for the paths that do not go to \"Rebound\": 14 (to Missed Shot) + 10 (to Foul) + 8 (to Made Shot) + 3 (to _Exit).\n7.  **Perform the final calculation:** 14 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 35.\n\nAlternatively, you can subtract the number of transitions *to* \"Rebound\" from the total number of \"UMD Offense\" events: 69 (total) - 34 (to Rebound) = 35.",
