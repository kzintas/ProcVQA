  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I need to locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram. I can see it in the upper-middle section.\n2.  Next, I need to identify the paths that lead directly from the 'Emergency' node to another node. There are three such paths.\n3.  One path goes from 'Emergency' to 'Floor' with a value of 21.\n4.  Another path goes from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' with a value of 41.\n5.  The third path goes from 'Emergency' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n6.  The question specifically asks for the number of patients discharged alive *directly* after an Emergency. This corresponds to the link between the 'Emergency' node and the 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n7.  By examining the label on this specific link, I can see the value is 38.\n8.  Therefore, 38 patients were discharged alive directly after an Emergency.",
