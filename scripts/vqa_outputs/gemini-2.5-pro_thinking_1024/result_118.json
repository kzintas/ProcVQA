  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks for the total shots made by \"UMD Offense\". I will start at the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n2.  **Trace all paths from UMD Offense:** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are several outgoing paths. I need to find all paths that eventually lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n3.  **Find the first path to \"Made Shot\":** There is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to the \"Made Shot\" node. The numeric label on this link is 8. This accounts for 8 made shots.\n4.  **Find other paths to \"Made Shot\":** I will examine the other branches from \"UMD Offense\":\n    *   \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" (34 sequences).\n    *   \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Missed Shot\" (14 sequences).\n    *   \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Foul\" (10 sequences).\n    *   \"UMD Offense\" -> \"_Exit\" (3 sequences).\n5.  **Analyze the \"Rebound\" sub-path:** From the \"Rebound\" node, there is a path leading to a \"Made Shot\" node. The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with the number 15. This accounts for another 15 made shots that occurred after a rebound.\n6.  **Analyze other sub-paths:**\n    *   The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" does not lead to any \"Made Shot\" events.\n    *   The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" leads to \"Made Free Throw\" and \"_Exit\", but not to \"Made Shot\". A \"Made Free Throw\" is a different event type.\n7.  **Calculate the total:** To get the total number of shots made by UMD Offense, I will sum the counts from all identified paths leading to a \"Made Shot\".\n    *   Directly from UMD Offense: 8\n    *   After a Rebound: 15\n    *   Total = 8 + 15 = 23.",
