I search the diagram for a node labeled 'Floor' that comes after the 'ICU' node.\n5.  There is no node labeled 'Floor' anywhere in the diagram, and specifically, there is no outgoing link from 'ICU' to a 'Floor' node.\n6.  The total number of patients entering the 'ICU' is 62. The sum of patients on the outgoing paths is 36 (to 'Die') + 26 (to '_Exit') = 62. This accounts for all patients who entered the ICU, confirming that no other paths from the ICU exist in this dataset.\n7.  Since no path exists from 'ICU' to 'Floor', the number of patients who followed such a path is 0.",
