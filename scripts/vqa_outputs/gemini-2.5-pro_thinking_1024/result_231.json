  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I first locate the node labeled 'UNC Offense' in the node-link diagram.\n2.  I then look for any nodes that are directly connected to and positioned below the 'UNC Offense' node, which indicates they occur immediately after.\n3.  I specifically search for a node labeled 'Jump Ball' among these subsequent events.\n4.  In the leftmost sequence column, I find a path that goes from `_Start` (count 2) to `UNC Offense` (count 2).\n5.  Following this 'UNC Offense' node, the path splits, with one link leading directly to a node labeled 'Jump Ball'.\n6.  The numeric label next to the 'Jump Ball' node indicates the number of sequences that include this event at this specific point in the pathway. This value is 1.\n7.  Therefore, a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense 1 time.",
