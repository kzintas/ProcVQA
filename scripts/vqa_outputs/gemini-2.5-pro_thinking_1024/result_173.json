I then trace the outgoing links from the \"UNC Offense\" node to find the one that leads to a \"Foul\" node.\n3.  I find a directed link going from \"UNC Offense\" to a \"Foul\" node. The numerical label on this link is 8.\n4.  I then follow the path from this \"Foul\" node to see where it leads. There is a single outgoing link from this \"Foul\" node.\n5.  This link connects the \"Foul\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node. The numerical label on this link is also 8.\n6.  This confirms that there is a sequence of events: UNC Offense -> Foul -> UMD Offense. The number of times this specific sequence occurred is given by the value on the links, which is 8.",
