  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "62",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I first locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram. It is positioned centrally, following the 'Arrival' node.\n2.  From the 'Emergency' node, the diagram shows two diverging pathways. One path leads to the 'ICU' node, and the other leads to the 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n3.  The question asks for the number of patients who went to the 'ICU' after 'Emergency'. I need to examine the link connecting the 'Emergency' node to the 'ICU' node.\n4.  Following the directed link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU', I observe a numeric label on this link.\n5.  The label on the link connecting 'Emergency' to 'ICU' is '62'. This number represents the count of sequences that followed this specific path.\n6.  Therefore, according to the visualization, 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.",
