  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting event:** The question asks about patients who arrived at 'Emergency'. I locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace the flow from 'Emergency':** All patients start at '_Start' (100), go to 'Arrival' (100), and then to 'Emergency' (100). From 'Emergency', the flow splits.\n3.  **Analyze paths originating from 'Emergency':**\n    *   A path goes from 'Emergency' to 'ICU'. The label on this link is 62, meaning 62 patients went to the ICU.\n    *   Another path goes from 'Emergency' to 'Discharge-Alive'. The label on this link is 38. These patients did not die.\n4.  **Trace the path that leads to death:** I need to find the 'Die' node and see how many patients from 'Emergency' reached it.\n    *   The 'Die' node is reached from the 'ICU' node.\n    *   The path is: `Emergency` -> `ICU` -> `Die`.\n5.  **Determine the count for the death path:**\n    *   The link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' shows 62 patients.\n    *   From 'ICU', the link to 'Die' has a numeric label of 36.\n    *   This indicates that out of the 62 patients who went to the ICU from Emergency, 36 followed the path to 'Die'.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** There are no other paths from 'Emergency' that lead to the 'Die' node. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
