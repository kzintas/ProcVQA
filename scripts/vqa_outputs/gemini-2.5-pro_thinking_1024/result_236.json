  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "3",
  "llm_answer": "3",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Goal:** Determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n2.  **Strategy:** I need to find nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\" and identify which of these events are attributed to \"UMD Offense\". The diagram shows sequences of events. An event is attributed to a team if it follows a node representing that team's offense.\n3.  **Analysis of the diagram:**\n    *   I will scan the diagram for \"UMD Offense\" nodes and trace the pathways originating from them.\n    *   In the third column from the left, there is a node `UMD Offense` with a count of 10.\n    *   Following the path from this `UMD Offense` (10) node, the diagram shows a link to a `Made Free Throw` node.\n    *   The numeric label next to this `Made Free Throw` node is 3.\n    *   This indicates that out of the 10 sequences that passed through the `UMD Offense` node at that point, 3 of them resulted in a 'Made Free Throw' event.\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   I will check other \"Made Free Throw\" nodes.\n    *   There is another `Made Free Throw` node in the third column, with a count of 11. Tracing the path leading to this node, it originates from a `Foul` node, which in turn originates from a `UNC Offense` node. Therefore, these 11 made free throws are associated with UNC Offense, not UMD Offense.\n    *   I have scanned the entire diagram and found no other instances of a \"Made Free Throw\" event following a \"UMD Offense\" node.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the explicit pathways shown in the visualization, there is only one instance where UMD Offense leads to a Made Free Throw, and this pathway accounts for 3 sequences. Therefore, UMD Offense made 3 free throws.",
