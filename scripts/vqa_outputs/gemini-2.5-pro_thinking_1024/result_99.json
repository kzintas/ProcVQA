I will then sum the counts from all such pathways.\n\n3.  **Pathway Analysis:** The visualization shows four distinct pathways from left to right.\n\n    *   **Pathway 1 (leftmost):**\n        *   The sequence is `_Start` (12) -> `Arrival` (12) -> `Emergency` (12) -> `ICU` (12) -> `Die` (12).\n        *   In this path, 12 patients who were in Emergency eventually died.\n\n    *   **Pathway 2 (second from left):**\n        *   The sequence is `_Start` (37) -> `Arrival` (37) -> `Emergency` (37) -> `Discharge-Alive` (37).\n        *   This pathway does not end in 'Die'.
