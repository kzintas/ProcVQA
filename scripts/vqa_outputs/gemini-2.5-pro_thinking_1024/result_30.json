  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I start by looking for the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram.\n2.  I then trace the path leading to this node to determine how many sequences (patients) reach this event.\n3.  The diagram shows a path from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  The link for this path has a numeric label of 38.\n5.  This indicates that 38 sequences followed the path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n6.  The path from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\" also confirms this number, showing a value of 38.\n7.  Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.",
