  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n2.  I will examine the provided node-link diagram to find information about \"free throws\".\n3.  I will trace the paths starting from the `UMD Offense` node. The paths from `UMD Offense` lead to `Rebound`, `Missed Shot`, and `_Exit`.\n4.  The path through `Rebound` leads to `Made Shot` and `_Exit`.\n5.  I will inspect all the node labels in the diagram: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, `Missed Shot`, `Made Shot`, `_Exit`.\n6.  The diagram includes nodes for \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\", but it does not specify the type of shot (e.g., field goal, layup, free throw).\n7.  Since there is no node or label explicitly mentioning \"Free Throw\", it is impossible to determine how many, if any, of the \"Made Shot\" events were free throws.\n8.  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the visualization.",
