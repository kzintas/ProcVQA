  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n2.  Next, I examine the directed links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node to see what events follow it.\n3.  There are two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":\n    *   One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node. The label on this link is 34, indicating that \"UMD Offense\" was followed by \"Rebound\" 34 times.\n    *   The other link goes to the \"_Exit\" node. The label on this link is 35.\n4.  The question asks how many times \"UMD Offense\" did *not* transition to a \"Rebound\".\n5.  Based on the diagram, the only alternative path from \"UMD Offense\" that isn't to \"Rebound\" is the path to \"_Exit\".\n6.  The number of sequences following this path is explicitly labeled as 35. Therefore, \"UMD Offense\" did not transition to a \"Rebound\" 35 times.",
