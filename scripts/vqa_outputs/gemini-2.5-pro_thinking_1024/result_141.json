  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I first locate the node labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n2.  I then examine the directed links originating from the \"Rebound\" node. There are two such links.\n3.  One link points to the \"Made Shot\" node, representing the sequence where a rebound is followed by a made shot.\n4.  The other link points to the \"_Exit\" node, representing sequences that end after a rebound.\n5.  The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a rebound. This corresponds to the path from the \"Rebound\" node to the \"Made Shot\" node.\n6.  I read the numeric label on the link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\". The value is 15.\n7.  This number explicitly indicates that there were 15 instances where a \"Made Shot\" event occurred immediately after a \"Rebound\" event.",
