  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user's question asks for the number of steals that occurred after the 'UMD Offense' event.\n2.  I first locate the node labeled 'UMD Offense' in the diagram.\n3.  I then examine the nodes that follow 'UMD Offense'. There are two outgoing links from 'UMD Offense'.\n4.  One link points to the 'Rebound' node, and the other points to the '_Exit' node.\n5.  I scan the entire diagram to find a node labeled 'Steal'.\n6.  The nodes present in the diagram are: '_Start', 'UNC Offense', 'Made Shot', 'Missed Shot', 'UMD Offense', 'Rebound', and '_Exit'.\n7.  There is no node labeled 'Steal' in the visualization.\n8.  Since the event 'Steal' is not represented in the diagram, it is impossible to determine how many times it occurred after 'UMD Offense'. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the provided information.",
