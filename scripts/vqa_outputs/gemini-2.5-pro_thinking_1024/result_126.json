  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Starting Point:** The question asks for the total shots made by the \"UMD Offense\". I will start by locating the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace Pathways to \"Made Shot\":** I will trace all the paths that originate from the \"UMD Offense\" node and lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n3.  **First Pathway:** One path goes directly from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot\". The numeric label on this link indicates that this sequence occurred 8 times.\n4.  **Second Pathway:** Another path goes from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". From the \"Rebound\" node, a path leads to \"Made Shot\". The numeric label on the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 15. This means there were 15 sequences where a UMD offense led to a rebound, which was then followed by a made shot.\n5.  **Other Pathways:** Other paths from \"UMD Offense\" lead to \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", and \"_Exit\". None of these paths subsequently lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n6.  **Calculate the Total:** To find the total number of made shots by the UMD offense, I need to sum the counts from all pathways that result in a \"Made Shot\".\n    *   Shots made directly: 8\n    *   Shots made after a rebound: 15\n    *   Total = 8 + 15 = 23.",
