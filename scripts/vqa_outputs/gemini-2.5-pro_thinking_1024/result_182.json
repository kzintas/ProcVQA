  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the lower part of the diagram.\n2.  Next, I examine the directed links that originate from the \"UMD Offense\" node. These links represent the events that immediately follow a \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  I observe two outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node. One link points to a \"Rebound\" node, and the other points to an \"_Exit\" node.\n4.  The question specifically asks for the number of rebounds made after \"UMD Offense\". This corresponds to the pathway from the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Rebound\" node.\n5.  I read the numeric label on the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The value on this link is 34.\n6.  This number represents the count of sequences where a \"Rebound\" event directly followed a \"UMD Offense\" event.",
