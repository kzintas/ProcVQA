  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "20",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the total number of patients who were discharged alive immediately after being on the 'Floor'. This means I need to find all pathways where a 'Floor' node is directly followed by a 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n\n2.  **Scan the Diagram for 'Floor' Nodes:** I will examine each of the four vertical pathways shown in the visualization to find instances of the 'Floor' node.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pathway 1 (leftmost):** This pathway is `_Start` -> `Arrival` -> `Emergency` -> `ICU` -> `Die`. It does not contain a 'Floor' node.\n\n4.  **Analyze Pathway 2:** This pathway is `_Start` -> `Arrival` -> `Emergency` -> `Discharge-Alive`. It does not contain a 'Floor' node.\n\n5.  **Analyze Pathway 3 (third from left):**\n    *   The sequence is `_Start` (24) -> `Arrival` (24) -> `Emergency` (24) -> `ICU` (23) -> `Floor` (23).\n    *   Following the 'Floor' node, the next event is 'Discharge-Alive'.\n    *   The numeric label next to the 'Discharge-Alive' node in this pathway is 20.\n    *   This indicates that 20 patients followed the sequence from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n\n6.  **Analyze Pathway 4 (rightmost):**\n    *   The sequence is `_Start` (27) -> `Arrival` (27) -> `Emergency` (27) -> `Floor` (27).\n    *   Following the 'Floor' node, the next event is 'ICU'.\n    *   This pathway does not show patients going from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   Pathway 3 shows 20 patients going from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n    *   No other pathway shows patients going directly from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number is the sum of patients from all relevant pathways. In this case, it is just the 20 patients from the third pathway.",
