  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the total number of 'Made Free Throw' events that are attributed to 'UMD Offense'.\n\n2.  **Scan the Diagram for 'Made Free Throw' Nodes:** I will locate all nodes labeled 'Made Free Throw' and examine their context within the event sequences.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First 'Made Free Throw' Node:**\n    *   I find a 'Made Free Throw' node in the third column from the left with a count of 13.\n    *   To determine which team made these free throws, I trace the path upwards from this node.\n    *   The preceding node is 'Foul' (count 15).\n    *   The node before 'Foul' is 'UNC Offense' (count 15).\n    *   This sequence (`_Start` -> `UNC Offense` -> `Foul`) indicates that a foul occurred while UNC had possession of the ball. Typically, this means the defending team (UMD) committed the foul, and UNC would be the team shooting the free throws. The diagram does not show any path originating from 'UMD Offense' that leads to this 'Made Free Throw' node. Therefore, these 13 made free throws are not associated with UMD Offense.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second 'Made Free Throw' Node:**\n    *   I find another 'Made Free Throw' node directly below the first one, also in the third column, with a count of 8.\n    *   This node follows the first 'Made Free Throw' node, indicating a sequence where a second free throw was made.\n    *   Since the first free throw was determined to be by UNC, this second one in the same possession is also by UNC.\n    *   Tracing the path downwards from this node leads to 'UMD Offense' (count 8), which is the expected outcome after a successful final free throw (the non-shooting team gets possession). This confirms that UMD was not the shooting team.\n\n5.  **Scan for Other 'Made Free Throw' Nodes:** I have examined the entire diagram and there are no other nodes labeled 'Made Free Throw'.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The visualization shows sequences for made free throws, but these sequences originate from a 'UNC Offense' possession. There are no event sequences in the diagram where 'UMD Offense' leads to a 'Made Free Throw' event. Therefore, based solely on the provided visualization, the number of free throws made by UMD Offense is zero.",
