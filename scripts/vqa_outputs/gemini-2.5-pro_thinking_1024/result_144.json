I will examine the provided node-link diagram to find any information related to \"free throws\".\n3.  I scan all the node labels in the diagram: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, `Missed Shot`, `Made Shot`, and `_Exit`.\n4.  None of the nodes are labeled \"Free Throw\". The diagram shows events like \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\", but it does not specify whether these shots are field goals or free throws.\n5.  Since the visualization does not contain any node or information to distinguish between different types of shots (e.g., field goal vs. free throw), it is impossible to determine the number of free throws made.",
