  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The question asks for the number of transitions from the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node. I will locate these two nodes in the diagram.\n2.  **Locate the starting node:** The \"UNC Offense\" node is located near the top of the diagram, just below the \"_Start\" node.\n3.  **Locate the destination node:** The \"UMD Offense\" node is located in the middle of the diagram, below \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n4.  **Find the connecting link:** I will trace the directed links originating from the \"UNC Offense\" node. There are three outgoing links.\n5.  **Isolate the specific path:** One of these links goes directly from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n6.  **Read the associated value:** The numeric label next to this specific link is \"23\". This value represents the number of sequences that followed this path.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 23 times.",
