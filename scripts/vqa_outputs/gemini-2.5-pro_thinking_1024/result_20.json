There are two paths leaving the 'Emergency' node:\n    *   One path goes to the 'ICU' node, with a label of 62. This means 62 sequences went from Emergency to ICU.\n    *   The other path goes directly to the 'Discharge-Alive' node, with a label of 38.\n4.  The question asks for the number of patients who were discharged alive *directly* after arriving at Emergency. This corresponds to the second path identified.\n5.  The numeric label on the link from 'Emergency' to 'Discharge-Alive' is 38.",
