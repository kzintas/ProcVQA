  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the total number of patients who were discharged alive.\n2.  I need to locate all nodes labeled 'Discharge-Alive' in the provided node-link diagram.\n3.  I will examine each of the four vertical pathways shown in the visualization.\n4.  In the second pathway from the left, there is a node labeled 'Discharge-Alive'. The numeric label next to this node is 37. This means 37 sequences (patients) followed this path and were discharged alive.\n5.  In the third pathway from the left, there is another node labeled 'Discharge-Alive'. The numeric label next to this node is 20. This means 20 sequences (patients) followed this path and were discharged alive.\n6.  The first and fourth pathways do not contain a 'Discharge-Alive' node; they both end in 'Die'.\n7.  To find the total number of patients discharged alive, I will sum the counts from all identified 'Discharge-Alive' nodes.\n8.  Calculation: 37 (from the second pathway) + 20 (from the third pathway) = 57.",
