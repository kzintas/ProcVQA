  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about sequences starting from the \"UMD Offense\" node. I located this node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify all outgoing paths from \"UMD Offense\":** I examined all the links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node and their corresponding event counts. The paths are:\n    *   UMD Offense -> Rebound: 34 sequences\n    *   UMD Offense -> Missed Shot: 14 sequences\n    *   UMD Offense -> Foul: 10 sequences\n    *   UMD Offense -> Made Shot: 8 sequences\n    *   UMD Offense -> _Exit: 3 sequences\n3.  **Identify the paths that are *not* a transition to \"Rebound\":** The question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound. This means I need to sum the counts of all outgoing paths from \"UMD Offense\" except for the one leading to \"Rebound\".\n4.  **Sum the counts of the relevant paths:**\n    *   Count for \"Missed Shot\": 14\n    *   Count for \"Foul\": 10\n    *   Count for \"Made Shot\": 8\n    *   Count for \"_Exit\": 3\n5.  **Calculate the total:** I will add these counts together: 14 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 35.\n\nTherefore, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.",
