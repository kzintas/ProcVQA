  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at 'Emergency'. I will start by locating the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace pathways from 'Emergency':** Following the 'Emergency' node, the diagram shows the flow of patients splits into three main paths:\n    *   A path directly to 'Discharge-Alive' with a count of 38. These patients did not die.\n    *   A path to 'Floor' with a count of 21. From this 'Floor' node, all 21 patients proceed to 'ICU'.\n    *   A path directly to 'ICU' with a count of 41.\n3.  **Trace pathways leading to 'Die':** I will now locate the 'Die' node and trace the paths leading into it.\n    *   There is only one incoming link to the 'Die' node. This link originates from the 'ICU' node.\n    *   This means any patient who died must have passed through the 'ICU'.\n4.  **Calculate the number of patients who died:** The link from the 'ICU' node to the 'Die' node has a numeric label of 36. This indicates that 36 patients who reached the 'ICU' subsequently died.\n5.  **Confirm the flow:** The paths from 'Emergency' that could lead to death are those going to 'ICU' (either directly or via 'Floor'). All patients who die come from the 'ICU' node, and the number on that specific path (ICU -> Die) is 36.\n6.  **Final check:** The question asks for the total number of patients who died after 'Emergency'. The diagram explicitly shows that 36 patients followed a path that ended in 'Die'. There are no other pathways leading to the 'Die' node. Therefore, the total number is 36.",
