  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking for the number of patients who were discharged alive after visiting the \"Floor\".\n2.  This requires finding a path in the diagram that includes the node \"Floor\" followed by the node \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  I have examined all the nodes present in the provided node-link diagram.\n4.  The nodes shown are: `_Start`, `Arrival`, `Emergency`, `ICU`, `Die`, `_Exit`, and `Discharge-Alive`.\n5.  There is no node labeled \"Floor\" in the diagram.\n6.  Since the \"Floor\" node does not exist in the visualization, it is impossible to determine how many patients went from the \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".",
