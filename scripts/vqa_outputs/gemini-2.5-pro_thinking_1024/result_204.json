  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",

  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to find the total count of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur in sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\" and happening before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2.  **Scan the Diagram:** I will examine each vertical pathway in the node-link diagram to trace sequences that include \"UNC Offense\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\" in that chronological order (top to bottom).\n\n3.  **Analyze Pathway 1 (starting with _Start 7):**\n    *   The sequence starts with `_Start` (7) -> `UNC Offense` (7).\n    *   Following `UNC Offense` (7), the next event is `Missed Shot` (7).\n    *   Following `Missed Shot` (7), the next event is `UMD Offense` (7).\n    *   This pathway matches the criteria: `UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense`.\n    *   The count for this `Missed Shot` event is **7**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Pathway 2 (starting with _Start 14):**\n    *   The sequence starts with `_Start` (14) -> `UNC Offense` (14).\n    *   Following `UNC Offense` (14), the sequence goes to `Rebound` (14).\n    *   Following `Rebound` (14), the next event is `Missed Shot` (14).\n    *   Following `Missed Shot` (14), the next event is `UMD Offense` (13).\n    *   This pathway also matches the criteria: `UNC Offense` -> ... -> `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense`.\n    *   The count for this `Missed Shot` event is **14**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Other Pathways:**\n    *   **Pathway 3 (starting with _Start 4):** `UNC Offense` (4) branches into `Rebound` (1) and `Turnover` (2). `Turnover` leads to `UMD Offense` (2). There is no \"Missed Shot\" node between `UNC Offense` and `UMD Offense` in this path.\n    *   **Pathway 4 (starting with _Start 4):** `UNC Offense` (4) branches into `Jump Ball` (1) and `Foul` (3). Neither of these branches contains a \"Missed Shot\" before an exit or UMD Offense.\n    *   **Pathway 5 (starting with _Start 15):** `UNC Offense` (15) leads to `Foul` (15), which then leads to free throws. There is no \"Missed Shot\" from the field in this sequence before a potential `UMD Offense`.\n    *   **Pathway 6 (starting with _Start 25):** `UNC Offense` (25) leads to `Made Shot` (21) and `UMD Offense` (23). The path to `UMD Offense` contains a `Missed Shot` (15), but this `Missed Shot` occurs *after* `UMD Offense`, not before. Therefore, it does not meet the condition.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total:** I will sum the counts from the relevant pathways identified in steps 3 and 4.\n    *   Total = (Count from Pathway 1) + (Count from Pathway 2)\n    *   Total = 7 + 14 = 21\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The total number of missed shots occurring after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is 21.",
