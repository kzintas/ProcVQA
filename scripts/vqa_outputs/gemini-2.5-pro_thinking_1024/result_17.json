I will trace the pathways in the diagram to identify the sequence of events involving the 'Floor' and 'Discharge-Alive' nodes.\n3.  First, I locate the 'Floor' node in the diagram.\n4.  I observe the links originating from the 'Floor' node. There is a single directed link from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n5.  The numeric label on this link, representing the number of sequences (patients) following this path, is 24.\n6.  This indicates that 24 patients went from the 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n7.
