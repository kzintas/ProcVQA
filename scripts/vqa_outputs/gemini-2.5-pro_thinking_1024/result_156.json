  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to know the number of missed shots immediately following the 'UMD Offense' event.\n2.  In the context of sports analytics, a 'Rebound' event typically occurs after a missed shot attempt. Therefore, the pathway from 'UMD Offense' to 'Rebound' represents sequences where a shot was missed.\n3.  I will locate the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.\n4.  From the 'UMD Offense' node, there is a directed link going to the 'Rebound' node.\n5.  The numeric label on this link indicates the number of sequences that follow this path.\n6.  The label on the link from 'UMD Offense' to 'Rebound' is 34.\n7.  Thus, there were 34 instances where a 'Rebound' followed a 'UMD Offense', which implies 34 missed shots.",
