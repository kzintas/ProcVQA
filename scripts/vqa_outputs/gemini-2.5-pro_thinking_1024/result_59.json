  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting event:** The question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at 'Emergency'. I will start by locating the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace the paths from 'Emergency':** From the 'Emergency' node, the flow of 100 patients splits into two paths:\n    *   A path to the 'ICU' node, with a value of 62.\n    *   A path to the 'Discharge-Alive' node, with a value of 38.\n3.  **Identify the target event:** The question is about patients who 'Died'. I will locate the 'Die' node.\n4.  **Follow the path to 'Die':** The 'Die' node is only reachable from the 'ICU' node. The path is: Emergency -> ICU -> Die.\n5.  **Determine the count:** The link from the 'ICU' node to the 'Die' node has a numeric label of 36. This indicates that 36 patients who went to the ICU subsequently died. Since all patients who died first went through Emergency and then ICU, this is the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.",
