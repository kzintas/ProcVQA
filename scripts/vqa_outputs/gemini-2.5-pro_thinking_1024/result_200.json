  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant node:** The question asks for the total number of rebounds. I will locate the node labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n2.  **Analyze incoming links:** I will examine the links that point *to* the \"Rebound\" node to determine how many sequences led to this event.\n3.  **Find the count:** There is one link pointing from the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Rebound\" node. The numeric label on this link is \"34\".\n4.  **Interpret the count:** This label indicates that there were 34 sequences in which a \"UMD Offense\" was followed by a \"Rebound\". This number represents the total count of the \"Rebound\" event occurring in the paths shown.\n5.  **Analyze outgoing links (for confirmation):** There is one link from \"Rebound\" to \"_Exit\" with a count of \"24\". This indicates that the diagram is potentially incomplete or only shows paths of a certain length, as the number of sequences entering the \"Rebound\" node (34) does not equal the number of sequences exiting it (24). However, the number of events is determined by the flow *into* the event node. The most direct measure of how many rebounds occurred is the count on the path leading to the \"Rebound\" node.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\", the total number of rebounds recorded in the diagram is 34.",
