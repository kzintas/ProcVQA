  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the total number of patients who were discharged alive.\n2.  I will locate the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram.\n3.  I will then identify all the links pointing *to* this \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  The diagram shows one incoming link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, which originates from the \"Emergency\" node.\n5.  The numeric label on this link indicates the number of sequences (patients) that followed this path. The value on the link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 38.\n6.  Since this is the only path leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.\n7.  The link leaving the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and going to \"_Exit\" also has a value of 38, which confirms that all 38 patients who were discharged alive subsequently exited the pathway.",
