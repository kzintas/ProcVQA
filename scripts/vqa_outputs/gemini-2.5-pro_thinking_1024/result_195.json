  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to know the number of \"Steals\" that occurred after the \"UMD Offense\" event.\n2.  I first locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n3.  I then examine the nodes that directly follow \"UMD Offense\" by looking at the outgoing links.\n4.  There are two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\". One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node, and the other goes to the \"_Exit\" node.\n5.  I scan all the nodes in the entire visualization to see if an event named \"Steal\" is represented. The nodes present are: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `Made Shot`, `Missed Shot`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, and `_Exit`.\n6.  There is no node labeled \"Steal\" anywhere in the diagram.\n7.  Since the \"Steal\" event is not represented as a node in the visualization, it is impossible to determine how many times it occurred after \"UMD Offense\".",
