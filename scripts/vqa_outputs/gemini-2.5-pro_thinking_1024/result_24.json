  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the \"Emergency\" node in the diagram.\n2.  I trace the paths that originate from the \"Emergency\" node. There are two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to the \"ICU\" node with a value of 62.\n    *   Another link goes to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node with a value of 38.\n3.  I need to find the path that leads to the \"Die\" node. The path through \"Discharge-Alive\" does not lead to \"Die\".\n4.  I follow the path from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\". The diagram shows that 62 sequences follow this path.\n5.  From the \"ICU\" node, I trace the outgoing links. There are two:\n    *   One link goes to the \"Die\" node with a value of 36.\n    *   Another link goes to the \"_Exit\" node with a value of 26.\n6.  The number of patients who died is represented by the link going from \"ICU\" to \"Die\". The value on this link is 36.\n7.  Therefore, 36 patients who came from Emergency and went to ICU eventually died.",
