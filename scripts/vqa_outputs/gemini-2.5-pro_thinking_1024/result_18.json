  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about patients after arriving at 'Emergency'. I locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace pathways from the 'Emergency' node:** From the 'Emergency' node, the diagram shows two outgoing paths:\n    *   A path to the 'ICU' node with a value of 62. This means 62 patients went from Emergency to ICU.\n    *   A path to the 'Discharge-Alive' node with a value of 38. This path does not lead to the 'Die' node.\n3.  **Trace pathways from the 'ICU' node:** Since the path to 'ICU' is the only one that could potentially lead to death, I follow the paths from the 'ICU' node:\n    *   A path goes from 'ICU' to the 'Die' node. The label on this link is 36. This represents 36 patients who went from ICU and died.\n    *   Other paths from 'ICU' go to 'Floor' (24 patients) and '_Exit' (2 patients), neither of which leads to the 'Die' node.\n4.  **Count the relevant patients:** The only pathway from 'Emergency' that results in death is Emergency -> ICU -> Die. The number of patients who followed the final step of this pathway (ICU -> Die) is explicitly given as 36.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, 36 patients who arrived at Emergency eventually died.",
