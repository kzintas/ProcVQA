  "reasoning": "1.  **Locate the 'UMD Offense' node:** I first find the node labeled 'UMD Offense' in the lower half of the diagram.\n2.  **Identify outgoing links:** I then examine the links originating from the 'UMD Offense' node to see the subsequent events.\n3.  **Find the specific path to 'Steal':** I look for a link that goes from the 'UMD Offense' node to a node labeled 'Steal'. I find one such link on the right side.\n4.  **Read the count on the link:** The numeric label next to this specific link indicates the number of sequences that follow this path. The value on the link from 'UMD Offense' to 'Steal' is explicitly labeled as '4'.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, according to the diagram, 4 steals occurred after UMD Offense.",
