  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",

  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the number of times the event 'UMD Offense' immediately followed the event 'UNC Offense'.\n\n2.  **Locate the Nodes:** I need to find the 'UNC Offense' node and the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.\n    *   'UNC Offense' is the second node from the top.\n    *   'UMD Offense' is the fourth node from the top.\n\n3.  **Find the Direct Link:** I will look for a directed link (an arrow, represented by a path) that goes directly from the 'UNC Offense' node to the 'UMD Offense' node.\n\n4.  **Trace the Path:** Following the paths originating from 'UNC Offense', I can see three outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to 'Made Shot'.\n    *   One link goes to 'Missed Shot'.\n    *   A third, curved link on the left side goes directly to 'UMD Offense'.\n\n5.  **Read the Value:** The numeric label on the link connecting 'UNC Offense' directly to 'UMD Offense' is '23'. This number represents the count of sequences that followed this specific path.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, 'UMD Offense' transitioned directly from 'UNC Offense' 23 times.",
