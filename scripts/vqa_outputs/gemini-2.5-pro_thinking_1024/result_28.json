  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking for the number of patients who were discharged alive *after* going to the \"Floor\".\n2.  This requires finding a pathway in the diagram that includes a node labeled \"Floor\" and subsequently a node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  I have examined all the nodes present in the visualization. The nodes are: `_Start`, `Arrival`, `Emergency`, `ICU`, `Die`, `Discharge-Alive`, and `_Exit`.\n4.  There is no node labeled \"Floor\" anywhere in the diagram.\n5.  Since the \"Floor\" event is not represented, it is impossible to determine how many patients went to the \"Floor\" and were subsequently discharged alive based on this visualization.",
