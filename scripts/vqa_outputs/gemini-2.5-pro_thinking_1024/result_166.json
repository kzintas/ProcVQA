  "question": "How many fouls were made after UNC Offense and before UMD offense? ",
  "true_answer": "8",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the number of fouls that occurred in the sequence between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2.  **Locate the Key Nodes:**\n    *   Find the \"UNC Offense\" node. It is located near the top of the diagram, just below the \"_Start\" node.\n    *   Find the \"UMD Offense\" node. It is located in the middle of the diagram, below \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   Find the \"Foul\" node that is positioned chronologically between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n\n3.  **Trace the Path:**\n    *   Start at the \"UNC Offense\" node.\n    *   Follow the directed links originating from \"UNC Offense\". There are four outgoing links.\n    *   One of these links points directly to a \"Foul\" node.\n    *   Examine the numeric label on this specific link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"Foul\". The label is \"8\".\n\n4.  **Confirm the Sequence:**\n    *   The path continues from this \"Foul\" node to other nodes (like \"Made Free Throw\") which eventually lead to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n    *   This confirms that the \"Foul\" node with 8 sequences is indeed part of the sequences that occur between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n\n5.  **Final Answer Derivation:** The number on the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Foul\" explicitly states the count of sequences that followed this path. This number is 8.",
