I will scan the entire visualization to locate all nodes with the label \"Rebound\".\n3.  In the second major pathway from the left, I find a node labeled \"Rebound\" with a numeric value of 19 next to it. This path follows the sequence `UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` -> `Rebound`.\n4.  Further down in the same pathway, I find another node labeled \"Rebound\" with a numeric value of 15 next to it. This path follows the sequence `UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense` -> `Rebound`.\n5.  I have scanned all other pathways and there are no other nodes labeled \"Rebound\".\n6.  To find the total number of rebounds, I will sum the values of all identified \"Rebound\" nodes.\n7.  The calculation is: 19 + 15 = 34.",
