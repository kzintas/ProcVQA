  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the number of patients who followed the sequence \"Floor\" then \"ICU\".\n2.  I will examine the provided node-link diagram, which shows four separate pathways.\n3.  I need to find a path where a node labeled \"Floor\" is directly followed by a node labeled \"ICU\". The vertical position indicates chronological order, so the \"ICU\" node must be below the \"Floor\" node in the same pathway.\n4.  I will analyze each of the four pathways shown:\n    *   **Pathway 1 (left):** The sequence is Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Die. There is no \"Floor\" node in this path.\n    *   **Pathway 2 (second from left):** The sequence is Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive. There is no \"Floor\" or \"ICU\" node in this path.\n    *   **Pathway 3 (third from left):** The sequence is Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive. In this path, \"ICU\" is followed by \"Floor\", which is the reverse of the requested sequence.\n    *   **Pathway 4 (right):** The sequence is Arrival -> Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die. This path contains the required sequence of \"Floor\" followed by \"ICU\".\n5.  To find the number of patients on this specific path, I will look at the numeric label associated with the link from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" or the \"ICU\" node in this specific sequence.\n6.  In Pathway 4, the node \"Floor\" has a count of 27. The path continues from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\". The \"ICU\" node in this pathway has a numeric label of 24.\n7.  This indicates that out of the 27 patients who were on the Floor, 24 of them subsequently went to the ICU. The link width also visually represents this flow.",
