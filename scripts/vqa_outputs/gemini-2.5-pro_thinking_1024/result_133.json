  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I first locate the \"Rebound\" node in the node-link diagram.\n2.  I then examine the links originating from the \"Rebound\" node to see what events follow it.\n3.  There are two outgoing links from the \"Rebound\" node.\n4.  One link points to the \"Made Shot\" node, and the other points to the \"_Exit\" node.\n5.  The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, which corresponds to the path from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n6.  I read the numeric label on the link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n7.  The value on this link is 15. This indicates that there were 15 sequences where a \"Made Shot\" event occurred immediately after a \"Rebound\" event.",
