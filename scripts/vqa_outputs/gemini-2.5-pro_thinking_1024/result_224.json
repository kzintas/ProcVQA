  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the number of times the event \"Jump Ball\" immediately followed the event \"UNC Offense\". This means I need to find a direct link from a \"UNC Offense\" node to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n\n2.  **Scan the Diagram for Relevant Nodes:** I will look for all instances of \"UNC Offense\" and \"Jump Ball\" nodes.\n\n3.  **Locate Nodes and Trace Paths:**\n    *   I locate a \"UNC Offense\" node in the far-left column. It has a count of 2.\n    *   Following the directed link down from this \"UNC Offense\" node, I see it connects to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n    *   The numeric label next to the \"Jump Ball\" node is 1. This number represents the count of sequences that followed the path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\".\n    *   I examine the other \"UNC Offense\" nodes in the other columns (with counts 19, 33, and 15) to see if they also lead to a \"Jump Ball\" event.\n    *   The \"UNC Offense\" node with count 19 leads to \"Rebound\".\n    *   The \"UNC Offense\" node with count 33 leads to \"Made Shot\".\n    *   The \"UNC Offense\" node with count 15 leads to \"Foul\".\n    *   None of these other \"UNC Offense\" nodes connect to a \"Jump Ball\" event.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the diagram, there is only one pathway from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\", and it occurred 1 time. The value next to the \"Jump Ball\" node confirms this count.",
