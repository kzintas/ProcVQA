  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant pathway:** The question asks for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\". This corresponds to the sequence of nodes: `UNC Offense` -> `Made Shot` -> `UMD Offense`.\n2.  **Trace the first step of the path:** I will start at the `UNC Offense` node and look for the link going to the `Made Shot` node.\n3.  **Read the value on the first link:** The link from `UNC Offense` to `Made Shot` has a numeric label of `22`. This indicates that 22 sequences followed this path.\n4.  **Trace the second step of the path:** From the `Made Shot` node, I will look for the link going to the `UMD Offense` node.\n5.  **Read the value on the second link:** The link from `Made Shot` to `UMD Offense` also has a numeric label of `22`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the flow of sequences from `UNC Offense` to `Made Shot` is 22, and the flow from `Made Shot` to `UMD Offense` is also 22, it means that all 22 of these \"Made Shot\" events occurred within this specific sequence. Therefore, there were 22 made shots after UNC Offense and before UMD offense.",
