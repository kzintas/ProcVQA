  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the total number of patients who were discharged alive.\n2.  I will examine the node-link diagram to find the node representing the \"Discharge-Alive\" event.\n3.  I have located the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4.  To determine how many patients were discharged alive, I need to look at the number of sequences flowing into this node.\n5.  There is a single incoming link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, originating from the \"Emergency\" node.\n6.  The numeric label on this link is \"38\".\n7.  This means that 38 patients followed the path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n8.  The link leaving the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and going to \"_Exit\" also has a value of 38, which confirms that 38 patients passed through this state.\n9.  Therefore, based on the visualization, 38 patients were discharged alive.",
