  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I will locate the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n2.  Next, I will examine the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node to identify the events that follow it.\n3.  The diagram shows two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\". One link goes to a node labeled \"Rebound\" with a value of 34, and the other link goes to a node labeled \"_Exit\" with a value of 22.\n4.  I will then search the entire diagram to see if there is any node labeled \"Steal\".\n5.  After reviewing all the nodes (_Start, UNC Offense, Made Shot, Rebound, Missed Shot, UMD Offense, _Exit), I can confirm that there is no node labeled \"Steal\" in the visualization.\n6.  Since the event \"Steal\" is not represented in the diagram, it is impossible to determine how many steals occurred after \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, the answer is indeterminate.",
