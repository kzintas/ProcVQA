  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** Locate the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify outgoing paths:** Observe the directed links (paths) originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node. There are three outgoing paths:\n    *   One path goes to the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   One path goes to the \"Missed Shot\" node.\n    *   One path goes to the \"_Exit\" node.\n3.  **Isolate relevant paths:** The question asks for the number of times \"UMD Offense\" did *not* transition to a \"Rebound\". This means we need to count the sequences that transitioned to \"Missed Shot\" and \"_Exit\".\n4.  **Extract the counts for the relevant paths:**\n    *   The numeric label on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" is 14.\n    *   The numeric label on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" is 21.\n5.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the counts of the paths that do not go to \"Rebound\": 14 (to Missed Shot) + 21 (to _Exit) = 35.\n\nAlternatively, one could find the total number of sequences leaving \"UMD Offense\" (which is 69, as shown by the incoming link) and subtract the number of sequences that went to \"Rebound\" (34). The result is 69 - 34 = 35.",
