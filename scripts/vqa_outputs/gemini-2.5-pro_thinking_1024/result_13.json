There are two nodes labeled 'Discharge-Alive'.\n4.  The first 'Discharge-Alive' node is part of the path `Emergency` -> `Discharge-Alive`. The numeric label on the link leading to this node is 38. This indicates that 38 patients were discharged alive directly from the Emergency department.\n5.  The second 'Discharge-Alive' node is part of the path `ICU` -> `Floor` -> `Discharge-Alive`. The numeric label on the link leading from 'Floor' to this 'Discharge-Alive' node is 24. This indicates that 24 patients were discharged alive after being on the Floor.\n6.  To find the total number of patients discharged alive, I need to sum the counts from all pathways that lead to a 'Discharge-Alive' event.\n7.  Total count = (patients discharged from Emergency) + (patients discharged from Floor).\n8.  Total count = 38 + 24 = 62.",
