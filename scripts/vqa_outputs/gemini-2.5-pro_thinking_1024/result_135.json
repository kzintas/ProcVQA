The diagram shows three events following \"UMD Offense\": \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n4.  I scan the entire diagram to see if there is any node labeled \"Foul\".\n5.  There is no node labeled \"Foul\" anywhere in the visualization.\n6.  Since there is no \"Foul\" event depicted in the diagram, it is impossible to determine how many fouls were committed by UMD Offense based solely on the provided information.",
