  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The question asks for the number of patients who were discharged alive after going to the \"Floor\". This requires finding the \"Floor\" node and tracing its path to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n2.  **Trace the path:**\n    *   Locate the \"Floor\" node in the diagram.\n    *   Observe the links originating from the \"Floor\" node. There is one outgoing link.\n    *   Follow this link to the next node, which is \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n3.  **Read the value on the link:**\n    *   The link connecting the \"Floor\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a numeric label next to it.\n    *   The value on this link is \"24\".\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The value \"24\" on the link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" represents the number of sequences (patients) who followed this specific path. Therefore, 24 patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor.",
