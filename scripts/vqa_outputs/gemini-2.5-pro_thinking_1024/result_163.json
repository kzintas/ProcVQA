  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "4",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The user is asking for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". Based on the vertical layout of the diagram, the node labeled \"Made Shot\" is chronologically positioned after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2.  **Locate the \"Made Shot\" node:** I will find the node labeled \"Made Shot\" in the diagram. It is located on the right side of the diagram, below the \"Rebound\" node.\n\n3.  **Trace the path to the \"Made Shot\" node:** I will trace the directed links (arrows) leading *into* the \"Made Shot\" node to determine how many sequences include this event.\n    *   There is a path starting from \"UNC Offense\" that goes to a \"Rebound\" node. The label on this link is 23.\n    *   From this \"Rebound\" node, there is a link pointing to the \"Made Shot\" node.\n\n4.  **Read the value on the relevant link:** The numeric label on the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" indicates the number of sequences that follow this specific path. The value on this link is 4.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, there are 4 sequences that include a \"Made Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\".",
