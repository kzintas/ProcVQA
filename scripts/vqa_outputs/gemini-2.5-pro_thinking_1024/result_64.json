  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking for the number of patients who were discharged alive after visiting the \"Floor\".\n2.  I need to find a pathway in the diagram that includes the node \"Floor\" followed by the node \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  I have examined all the nodes present in the visualization. The nodes are: `_Start`, `Arrival`, `Emergency`, `ICU`, `Die`, `_Exit`, and `Discharge-Alive`.\n4.  The node \"Floor\" is not present anywhere in the diagram.\n5.  Since the diagram does not contain any information about a \"Floor\" event, it is impossible to determine how many patients went to the \"Floor\" and were subsequently discharged alive.\n6.  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the provided visualization.",
