  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking to find the number of free throws made by \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  To answer this question, I need to scan the entire node-link diagram for any nodes that represent \"Free Throw\".\n3.  I have examined all the nodes and their labels in the provided diagram. The labels present are: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `Jump Ball`, `Missed Shot`, `Made Shot`, `_Exit`, `Rebound`, `UMD Offense`, and `Foul`.\n4.  There is no node with the label \"Free Throw\" anywhere in the visualization.\n5.  Since the diagram does not contain any information about free throws, it is impossible to determine how many were made by UMD Offense.\n6.  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the visualization.",
