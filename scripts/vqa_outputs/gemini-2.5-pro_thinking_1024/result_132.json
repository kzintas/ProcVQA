I identified the link that points directly to the \"Missed Shot\" node, as the question asks for shots missed *immediately after* UMD Offense.\n4.  I then read the numeric label on this specific link. The label shows the value \"14\".\n5.  This number represents the count of sequences where the event \"UMD Offense\" was immediately followed by the event \"Missed Shot\".",
