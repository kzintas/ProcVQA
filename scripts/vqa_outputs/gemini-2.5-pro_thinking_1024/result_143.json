I will examine the node-link diagram to find a node labeled \"Foul\" and see if it is connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n3.  I have scanned all the nodes in the diagram. The nodes present are: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, `Missed Shot`, `Made Shot`, and `_Exit`.\n4.  There is no node labeled \"Foul\" in the diagram.\n5.
