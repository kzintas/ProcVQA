  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking for the total number of free throws made by \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  To answer this, I need to find all event sequences that involve \"UMD Offense\" making a free throw.\n3.  I will scan the diagram for any nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\" and check which team's offense they are associated with.\n4.  I will examine each column of the diagram:\n    *   **Column 1:** Contains \"UMD Offense\" but no \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n    *   **Column 2:** Contains \"UMD Offense\" but no \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n    *   **Column 3:** Contains \"UMD Offense\" but no \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n    *   **Column 4:** Does not contain \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   **Column 5:** This column shows a sequence starting with \"UNC Offense\" (15) leading to a \"Foul\" (15). Following the \"Foul\", there are two \"Made Free Throw\" events. One is `Made Free Throw` with a count of 13. The other is `Made Free Throw` with a count of 8. The diagram shows a subsequent node `UMD Offense` with a count of 8, which is chronologically after the `Made Free Throw` (8) node. This indicates that the 8 made free throws are followed by a UMD possession. However, the team that *took* the free throws is the one that was fouled. In this sequence, the possession starts with \"UNC Offense\", and a \"Foul\" occurs during their possession. Therefore, UNC is the team shooting the free throws.\n    *   **Column 6:** This column shows a sequence starting with \"UNC Offense\" (25) leading to a \"Made Shot\" (21), which then leads to \"UMD Offense\" (23). No free throws are involved in this path.\n5.  Based on the analysis of all pathways in the diagram, there are no instances where \"UMD Offense\" is shown to be the team making a free throw. All \"Made Free Throw\" events depicted are a result of fouls committed against \"UNC Offense\".\n6.  Therefore, based solely on the provided visualization, the number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 0.",
