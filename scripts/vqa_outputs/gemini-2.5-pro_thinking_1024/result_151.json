  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I first locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  I then examine the events that follow the \"UMD Offense\" node. The diagram shows two directed links originating from \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node, and the other goes to the \"_Exit\" node.\n4.  The question asks for the number of \"Fouls\" made by UMD Offense.\n5.  I scan the entire diagram for a node labeled \"Foul\".\n6.  There is no node labeled \"Foul\" in the visualization. Therefore, there is no path from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Foul\" event.\n7.  Because the diagram does not contain any information about \"Fouls\", it is impossible to answer the question based solely on the provided visualization.",
