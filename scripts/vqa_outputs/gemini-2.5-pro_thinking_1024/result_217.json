  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Starting Node:** The user is asking for a sequence starting with \"UNC Offense\". I will locate the \"UNC Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify the Following Node:** The user is asking for the event that occurs immediately after \"UNC Offense\", which is \"Jump Ball\". I will locate the \"Jump Ball\" node.\n3.  **Trace the Path:** I will look for a direct, downward link connecting the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"Jump Ball\" node.\n4.  **Analyze the Diagram:**\n    *   In the first column on the left, there is a node labeled \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 2.\n    *   Following this node downwards, there is a directed link to a node labeled \"Jump Ball\".\n    *   The numeric label next to the \"Jump Ball\" node is 1. This number represents the total count of sequences that pass through this specific event.\n    *   Since there is only one incoming link to the \"Jump Ball\" node, and it comes from \"UNC Offense\", the count of 1 on the \"Jump Ball\" node represents the number of times this specific path (`UNC Offense` -> `Jump Ball`) occurred.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The visualization explicitly shows a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\", and the count associated with the \"Jump Ball\" node is 1. Therefore, a jump ball occurred 1 time after UNC Offense.",
