  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to know the total number of free throws made by \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  I need to examine the node-link diagram to find any information related to \"free throws\".\n3.  I will scan all the node labels in the diagram. The labels are: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, and `_Exit`.\n4.  The label \"Free Throw\" or any variation of it does not appear anywhere in the diagram.\n5.  The node \"UMD Offense\" exists, but the diagram only shows the sequences leading to and from this event. It does not provide any details about what specific actions (like free throws, shots, etc.) occurred within the \"UMD Offense\" event itself.\n6.  Since the diagram does not contain any data or nodes related to free throws, it is impossible to answer the question based solely on the provided visualization.",
