I will locate the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace outgoing links from the starting node:** I will follow all the directed links (arrows) that originate from the 'UMD Offense' node to see which events immediately follow it.\n3.  **Examine the destination nodes and link values:**\n    *   There is a link from 'UMD Offense' to 'Foul' with a value of 7.\n    *   There is a link from 'UMD Offense' to '_Exit' with a value of 8.\n    *   There is a link from 'UMD Offense' to 'Missed Shot' with a value of 16.\n    *   There is a link from 'UMD Offense' to 'Steal' with a value of 4.\n4.  **Check for the target event:** I am looking for a 'Rebound' node that is directly connected from the 'UMD Offense' node.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the outgoing links from 'UMD Offense', there are no sequences where a 'Rebound' event immediately follows 'UMD Offense'. Therefore, the count is 0.",
