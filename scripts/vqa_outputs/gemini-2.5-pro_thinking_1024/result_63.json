  "reasoning": "1.  First, I located the 'ICU' node in the provided node-link diagram.\n2.  Next, I examined all the outgoing links from the 'ICU' node to see where patients went next.\n3.  The diagram shows two distinct paths leaving the 'ICU' node:\n    *   A path to the 'Die' node, with a value of 36 on the link.\n    *   A path to the '_Exit' node, with a value of 26 on the link.\n4.  I then searched the entire diagram for a node labeled 'Floor'.\n5.  There is no node labeled 'Floor' anywhere in the visualization. Consequently, there is no path shown from 'ICU' to 'Floor'.\n6.  Since the diagram does not contain any information about patients going to the 'Floor', it is impossible to determine this number from the given visualization. Therefore, the answer is indeterminate.",
