  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I located the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the center of the diagram.\n2.  Next, I examined the directed links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node, which point to the events that occurred immediately after.\n3.  I identified four outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" leading to \"_Exit\", \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"Foul\".\n4.  The question asks for the number of rebounds made after \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, I focused on the link connecting the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Rebound\" node.\n5.  I read the numeric label associated with this specific link. The number on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is 27.\n6.  This number represents the count of sequences where a \"Rebound\" event directly followed a \"UMD Offense\" event.",
