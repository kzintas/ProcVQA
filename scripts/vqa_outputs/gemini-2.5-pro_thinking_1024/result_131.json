  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about transitions from the \"UMD Offense\" node. I will locate this node in the diagram.\n2.  **Analyze outgoing links:** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are three outgoing links to subsequent events:\n    *   A link to \"Rebound\" with a value of 34.\n    *   A link to \"Missed Shot\" with a value of 14.\n    *   A link to \"_Exit\" with a value of 21.\n3.  **Identify relevant transitions:** The question asks for the number of times \"UMD Offense\" did *not* transition to \"Rebound\". This means I need to count all the transitions from \"UMD Offense\" to nodes other than \"Rebound\".\n4.  **Sum the counts of non-Rebound transitions:** The transitions that do not go to \"Rebound\" are the ones going to \"Missed Shot\" and \"_Exit\".\n    *   The count for the transition to \"Missed Shot\" is 14.\n    *   The count for the transition to \"_Exit\" is 21.\n5.  **Calculate the total:** I will add the counts of these two transitions: 14 + 21 = 35.",
