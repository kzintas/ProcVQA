  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram. It is positioned in the lower-middle section.\n2.  Next, I identify the nodes that follow \"UMD Offense\" by examining the directed links originating from it. There are two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  One link goes from \"UMD Offense\" to the \"Rebound\" node.\n4.  The other link goes from \"UMD Offense\" to the \"_Exit\" node.\n5.  The question asks for the number of rebounds made after \"UMD Offense\". This corresponds to the pathway from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n6.  I look at the numeric label on the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n7.  The label on this link is \"34\".\n8.  This value represents the count of sequences where a \"Rebound\" event immediately followed a \"UMD Offense\" event.",
