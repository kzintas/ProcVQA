  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I will locate the \"Rebound\" node in the provided node-link diagram.\n2.  Next, I will examine the outgoing links from the \"Rebound\" node to see what event follows it.\n3.  The diagram shows one outgoing link from the \"Rebound\" node.\n4.  This link points directly to the \"_Exit\" node. The label on this link indicates that 34 sequences follow this path.\n5.  The question asks for the number of \"shots made\" directly after a \"Rebound\".\n6.  The visualization does not contain a node labeled \"Shot Made\" or any similar event that follows the \"Rebound\" node. The only subsequent event shown is \"_Exit\", which signifies the end of the sequence.\n7.  Because the diagram does not provide information about \"shots made\" after a \"Rebound\", the answer cannot be determined from the visualization.",
