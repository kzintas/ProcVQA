Following this, there are branches to `Jump Ball` (1) and `Missed Shot` (2). There is no \"Made Shot\" node in this pathway initiated by UNC Offense.\n    *   **Pathway 2 (starts with 14):** The sequence is `_Start` (14) -> `UNC Offense` (14). Following this, the events are `Rebound` (14) and `Missed Shot` (14). After the `Missed Shot`, possession changes to `UMD Offense`. There is no \"Made Shot\" by UNC in this pathway.\n    *   **Pathway 3 (starts with 12):** The sequence is `_Start` (12) -> `UNC Offense` (12). Following this, the paths diverge to `Rebound` (5) and `Foul` (9). These lead to other events, but none of them are a \"Made Shot\" under the UNC Offense phase.\n    *   **Pathway 4 (starts with 14):** The sequence is `_Start` (14) -> `UNC Offense` (14). Following this, paths diverge to `Steal` (6), `UMD Offense` (10), and `Made Shot` (3). The `Made Shot` node is directly under `UNC Offense`, indicating 3 shots were made during these sequences.\n    *   **Pathway 5 (starts with 9):** The sequence is `_Start` (9) -> `UNC Offense` (9). Following this is a `Missed Shot` (9). No made shots by UNC here.\n    *   **Pathway 6 (starts with 18):** The sequence is `_Start` (18) -> `UNC Offense` (18). Following this is a `Made Shot` node with the count `17`.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Calculate:**\n    *   From Pathway 4, I found a `Made Shot` node with a count of **3**.\n    *   From Pathway 6, I found a `Made Shot` node with a count of **17**.\n    *   The total number of made shots by UNC Offense is the sum of these counts.\n    *   Total = 3 + 17 = 20.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the diagram, UNC Offense made 20 shots in total across all the traced sequences.",
