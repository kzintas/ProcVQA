There are two outgoing links from \"Emergency\": one goes to the \"ICU\" node and the other goes to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  The question asks for the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency.\n5.  I examine the specific link that connects the \"Emergency\" node to the \"ICU\" node.\n6.  The numeric label on this link is explicitly shown as 62. This number represents the count of sequences that follow this path.\n7.  Therefore, 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.",
