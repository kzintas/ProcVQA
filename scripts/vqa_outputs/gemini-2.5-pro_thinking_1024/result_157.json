  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the node labeled 'Rebound' in the diagram.\n2.  Next, I examine the outgoing links from the 'Rebound' node to identify the event(s) that immediately follow it.\n3.  The diagram shows only one link extending downwards from the 'Rebound' node.\n4.  This link points to the '_Exit' node, indicating that all 34 sequences that included a 'Rebound' were followed by an '_Exit' event.\n5.  The question asks for the number of 'shots' made directly after a 'Rebound'.\n6.  Looking at the diagram, there is no node labeled 'Shot' or any similar term. More importantly, there are no links from the 'Rebound' node to any node other than '_Exit'.\n7.  Therefore, based on the provided visualization, zero shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
