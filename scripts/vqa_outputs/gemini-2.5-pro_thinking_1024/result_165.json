This means there were 15 rebounds in this context.\n    *   For the second \"Rebound\" node (right side), the link from \"UNC Offense\" has a value of `23`. This means there were 23 rebounds in this context.\n    *   For the third \"Rebound\" node (at the bottom), it follows a \"Missed Shot\" which comes after \"UMD Offense\". The link from \"Missed Shot\" to this \"Rebound\" node has a value of `7`. This means there were 7 rebounds in this context.\n4.  **Calculate the total:** To find the total number of rebounds, I will add the counts from all identified rebound events.\n    *   Total Rebounds = 15 + 23 + 7\n    *   Total Rebounds = 45",
