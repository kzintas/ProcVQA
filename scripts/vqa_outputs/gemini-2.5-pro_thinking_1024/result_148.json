  "question": "How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting event:** The question asks about events happening immediately after 'UMD Offense'. I will locate the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify the event for a missed shot:** A 'Rebound' event typically follows a missed shot. I will look for a 'Rebound' node following the 'UMD Offense' node.\n3.  **Trace the path:** The diagram shows a link originating from the 'UMD Offense' node and leading to the 'Rebound' node. This path represents the sequences where a rebound occurred after a UMD offensive possession, which implies a missed shot.\n4.  **Read the value on the link:** The numerical label on the link connecting 'UMD Offense' to 'Rebound' is 34.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This value indicates that there were 34 instances where a 'Rebound' event (and thus a missed shot) immediately followed a 'UMD Offense' event.",
