  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "16",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Starting Node:** First, I locate the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace Outgoing Paths to 'Foul' Events:** The question asks for the total fouls made by UMD Offense. I need to find all sequences originating from 'UMD Offense' that lead to a 'Foul' node.\n3.  **Path 1 (Direct Foul):** I trace the direct link from 'UMD Offense' to the 'Foul' node. The numeric label on this link is 10. This indicates 10 sequences where a UMD Offense possession resulted directly in a Foul.\n4.  **Path 2 (Foul after Rebound):** I examine other paths branching from 'UMD Offense'. One path goes to 'Rebound' with a value of 34. From the 'Rebound' node, there is a subsequent link to a 'Foul' node. The value on this link is 6. This represents 6 UMD Offense possessions that had a rebound, which was then followed by a foul.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** To find the total number of fouls made during a UMD Offense possession, I sum the counts from all paths leading to a 'Foul' event that originate from 'UMD Offense'.\n    *   Direct Fouls: 10\n    *   Fouls after a Rebound: 6\n    *   Total Fouls = 10 + 6 = 16.",
