  "question": "How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n2.  Next, I examine the directed links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node. These links show the events that follow \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  There are two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\": one goes to the \"Rebound\" node, and the other goes to the \"_Exit\" node.\n4.  The question specifically asks about the number of rebounds made after \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, I focus on the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n5.  I read the numeric label on this specific link. The value shown on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is 34.\n6.  This number represents the count of sequences where a \"Rebound\" event occurred immediately after a \"UMD Offense\" event.",
