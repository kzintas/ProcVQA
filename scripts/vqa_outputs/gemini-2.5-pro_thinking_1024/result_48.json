  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the total number of patients who were discharged alive. To do this, I need to identify all occurrences of the \"Discharge-Alive\" node in the diagram and sum the number of sequences passing through them.\n\n2.  I can see two distinct paths that lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" event:\n    *   **Path 1:** The path on the right side of the diagram shows a direct link from the \"Emergency\" node to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The numeric label on this link is 38. This means 38 patients followed this path.\n    *   **Path 2:** The path on the left side of the diagram shows a sequence from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" and then to \"Discharge-Alive\". The numeric label on the link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 24. This means 24 patients followed this path.\n\n3.  To get the total number of patients discharged alive, I will sum the counts from these two separate paths.\n    *   Total = (Count from Path 1) + (Count from Path 2)\n    *   Total = 38 + 24\n    *   Total = 62\n\n4.  Therefore, a total of 62 patients were discharged alive.",
