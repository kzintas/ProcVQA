  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the total number of \"Rebound\" events in the match, based on the provided node-link diagram.\n\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Node:** I will find the node labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n\n3.  **Analyze Incoming Links:** I will examine the links that point *to* the \"Rebound\" node to understand how many event sequences led to a rebound.\n    *   There is one link pointing to the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   This link originates from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n    *   The numeric label on this link is \"34\". This means there were 34 sequences where a \"UMD Offense\" was immediately followed by a \"Rebound\".\n\n4.  **Analyze Outgoing Links:** I will examine the links that point *away from* the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   There is one link pointing away from the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   This link points to the \"_Exit\" node.\n    *   The numeric label on this link is \"24\".\n\n5.  **Interpret the Data:** The number of sequences entering a node should ideally equal the number of sequences exiting it, unless the node is a starting or ending point for some sequences. In this diagram, there's a discrepancy: 34 sequences enter \"Rebound\", but only 24 exit. However, the question asks for the total number of rebounds. The link entering the \"Rebound\" node from \"UMD Offense\" explicitly states that this transition occurred 34 times. Therefore, the diagram indicates that the \"Rebound\" event occurred 34 times. The number on the incoming link represents the total count of events leading to that state.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Answer:** Based on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\", the event \"Rebound\" happened 34 times. I will state this as the final answer.",
