  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the 'UMD Offense' node in the middle of the diagram.\n2.  Next, I examine all the outgoing links from the 'UMD Offense' node to identify the subsequent events.\n3.  The diagram shows links from 'UMD Offense' to the following nodes:\n    *   '_Exit'\n    *   'Rebound'\n    *   'Missed Shot'\n    *   'Foul'\n4.  I scan these subsequent nodes and the entire diagram to find an event labeled 'Steal'.\n5.  There is no node labeled 'Steal' anywhere in the provided visualization.\n6.  Since the event 'Steal' is not represented in the diagram, it is impossible to determine how many times it occurred after 'UMD Offense'. Therefore, the answer is indeterminate based on the given information.",
