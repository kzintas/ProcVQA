  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",

  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the total number of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur in sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\" and eventually leading to \"UMD Offense\". The \"Missed Shot\" must happen chronologically between these two events.\n\n2.  **Scan for Relevant Pathways:** I will examine each column in the diagram to find pathways that contain the sequence `UNC Offense` -> ... -> `Missed Shot` -> ... -> `UMD Offense`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pathway 1 (Leftmost Column):**\n    *   The sequence starts with `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2).\n    *   From `UNC Offense` (2), one path goes to `Missed Shot` (2).\n    *   After `Missed Shot` (2), the sequence continues to `Made Shot` (2) and then `_Exit` (2).\n    *   This pathway does not contain a `UMD Offense` node after the `Missed Shot`. Therefore, these 2 missed shots do not meet the criteria.\n\n4.  **Analyze Pathway 2 (Second Column from Left):**\n    *   The sequence starts with `_Start` (19) -> `UNC Offense` (19).\n    *   The path continues to `Rebound` (19) -> `Missed Shot` (19).\n    *   Following the `Missed Shot` (19) node, the path leads to a `UMD Offense` (17) node.\n    *   This pathway matches the required pattern (`UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense`).\n    *   The number of sequences following this path is indicated by the value next to the `Missed Shot` node, which is **19**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Pathway 3 (Middle Column):**\n    *   The sequence is `_Start` (12) -> `UNC Offense` (12) -> `Foul` (12).\n    *   This pathway does not contain a \"Missed Shot\" event.\n\n6.  **Analyze Pathway 4 (Fourth Column from Left):**\n    *   The sequence is `_Start` (8) -> `UNC Offense` (8) -> `Turnover` (5) -> `UMD Offense` (7).\n    *   This pathway does not contain a \"Missed Shot\" event.\n\n7.  **Analyze Pathway 5 (Rightmost Column):**\n    *   The sequence starts with `_Start` (28) -> `UNC Offense` (28).\n    *   The path continues to `Made Shot` (20) and `Missed Shot` (19). Let's trace the `Missed Shot` path.\n    *   The path `UNC Offense` (28) -> `Missed Shot` (19) leads directly to an `_Exit` node with a count of 28 (which represents the total for this entire column's sequence group). There is no `UMD Offense` node after this `Missed Shot` in this specific path. Therefore, these 19 missed shots do not meet the criteria.\n\n8.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   Only the second pathway from the left contains the full sequence of `UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense`.\n    *   The count associated with the `Missed Shot` in this specific pathway is 19.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** The total count is the sum of all qualifying \"Missed Shot\" events. In this case, there is only one such instance with a count of 19.",
