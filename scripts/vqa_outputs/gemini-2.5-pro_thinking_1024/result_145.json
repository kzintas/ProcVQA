One link points to the \"Rebound\" node, and the other points to the \"_Exit\" node.\n4.  The question asks for the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense, which corresponds to the number of sequences that follow the path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n5.  I look at the numeric label on the link connecting the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Rebound\" node.\n6.  The label on this specific link is \"34\". This value represents the count of sequences that followed this path.",
