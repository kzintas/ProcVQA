  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I will locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram. It is positioned below the 'Arrival' node.\n2.  Next, I will examine the directed links that originate from the 'Emergency' node to see where patients go immediately after.\n3.  I observe three outgoing links from the 'Emergency' node:\n    *   One link goes to the 'Floor' node, with a value of 21.\n    *   One link goes to the 'ICU' node, with a value of 41.\n    *   One link goes directly to the 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n4.  The question specifically asks for the number of patients discharged alive *directly* after an Emergency. This corresponds to the link connecting the 'Emergency' node to the 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n5.  I will read the numeric label on this specific link. The label on the link from 'Emergency' to 'Discharge-Alive' is 38.\n6.  Therefore, 38 patients were discharged alive directly after an Emergency.",
