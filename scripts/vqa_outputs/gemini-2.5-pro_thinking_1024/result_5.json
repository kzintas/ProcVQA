  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks for patients who went to the \"Floor\". I locate the \"Floor\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace the path from the \"Floor\" node:** I look for outgoing links from the \"Floor\" node. There is one path leading out of the \"Floor\" node.\n3.  **Identify the destination node:** This path connects the \"Floor\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label on the link between \"Floor\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is 24.\n5.  **Interpret the value:** This means that 24 patients followed the sequence from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, 24 patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor.",
