  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the 'Rebound' node in the diagram. It is on the left side, one level below 'UMD Offense'.\n2.  Next, I examine the outgoing links from the 'Rebound' node to see what events followed it. There are four outgoing links from 'Rebound'.\n3.  These links point to the nodes: 'Made Shot', 'Missed Shot', 'Foul', and 'Turnover'.\n4.  The question asks for the number of shots that were made directly after a 'Rebound'. This corresponds to the pathway from the 'Rebound' node to the 'Made Shot' node.\n5.  I identify the specific link connecting 'Rebound' to 'Made Shot'.\n6.  I read the numeric label on this link. The label shows the value '15'.\n7.  According to the instructions, this number represents the count of sequences that follow this specific path. Therefore, there were 15 instances where a 'Rebound' was immediately followed by a 'Made Shot'.",
