  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks for patients who arrived at 'Emergency'. I locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace pathways from the 'Emergency' node:** From the 'Emergency' node, there are two outgoing paths:\n    *   One path leads to the 'ICU' node, with a count of 62 patients.\n    *   Another path leads to the 'Discharge-Alive' node, with a count of 38 patients.\n3.  **Identify the target node:** The question asks for the number of patients who 'died'. I locate the 'Die' node.\n4.  **Trace pathways leading to the 'Die' node:** There is only one path that leads to the 'Die' node. This path originates from the 'ICU' node.\n5.  **Connect the full sequence:** To find the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, I need to follow the sequence: Emergency -> ICU -> Die.\n6.  **Read the value on the relevant link:** The link connecting the 'ICU' node to the 'Die' node has a numeric label of 36. This number represents the count of patients who followed this specific path.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, based on the diagram, 36 patients who arrived at Emergency were subsequently admitted to the ICU and then died. The other path from Emergency (to Discharge-Alive) does not lead to death. So, the total number is 36.",
