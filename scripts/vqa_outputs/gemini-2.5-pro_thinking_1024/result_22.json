  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The question asks for the number of patients who went from the 'ICU' to the 'Floor'. Therefore, I need to locate the 'ICU' node and the 'Floor' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Locate the nodes:** The 'ICU' node is in the upper middle section of the diagram. The 'Floor' node is located below the 'ICU' node.\n3.  **Find the link between the nodes:** I will trace the directed links originating from the 'ICU' node. There is a link pointing from 'ICU' to 'Floor'.\n4.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label on the link connecting 'ICU' to 'Floor' is 24.\n5.  **Interpret the value:** According to the instructions, the numeric label on a link represents the count of sequences following that path. Therefore, 24 patients went from the ICU to the Floor.",
