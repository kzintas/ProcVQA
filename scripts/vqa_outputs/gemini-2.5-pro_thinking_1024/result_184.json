  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The question asks for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". I need to locate these three nodes in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace the path:** I will follow the directed links starting from the \"UNC Offense\" node. The diagram shows a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\".\n3.  **Find the link and its value:** There is a direct link from the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"Made Shot\" node. The numeric label on this link is 22. This indicates that 22 sequences followed this path.\n4.  **Confirm the sequence:** The question specifies that the \"Made Shot\" must be before \"UMD Offense\". I can see a link from the \"Made Shot\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node, also with a value of 22. This confirms that all 22 of these \"Made Shot\" events were followed by a \"UMD Offense\" event.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of sequences where a \"Made Shot\" follows a \"UNC Offense\" is 22. Therefore, there were 22 made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD offense.",
