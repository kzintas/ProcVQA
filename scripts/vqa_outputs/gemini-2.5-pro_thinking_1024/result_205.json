  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the total number of 'Rebound' events from the node-link diagram.\n2.  I will scan the entire diagram to locate all nodes labeled 'Rebound'.\n3.  For each 'Rebound' node found, I will read the numeric label next to it, which represents the count of sequences for that event.\n4.  I will then sum these counts to get the total number of rebounds.\n5.  I have identified the following 'Rebound' nodes and their counts:\n    *   In the first major pathway (starting with 7), there is a 'Rebound' node with a count of **7**.\n    *   In the second major pathway (starting with 14), there is a 'Rebound' node with a count of **14** and another 'Rebound' node with a count of **11**.\n    *   In the third major pathway (starting with 4), there is a 'Rebound' node with a count of **1**.\n6.  To find the total number of rebounds, I will add these values together: 7 + 14 + 11 + 1.\n7.  Calculation: 7 + 14 = 21; 21 + 11 = 32; 32 + 1 = 33.\n8.  The total number of rebounds is 33.",
