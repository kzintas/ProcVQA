  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking for the total number of made free throws by UMD Offense.\n2.  I will examine the node-link diagram to find information related to \"free throws\".\n3.  I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n4.  I trace the paths originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node. The subsequent events are \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Made Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n5.  I scan all the node labels in the entire diagram. The labels are: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Made Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n6.  The diagram does not contain any node or label explicitly mentioning \"free throws\".\n7.  The \"Made Shot\" node represents made shots in general, but it does not differentiate between field goals and free throws.\n8.  The \"Foul\" node might imply free throws, but the diagram only shows that sequences end after a foul (`Foul` -> `_Exit`), without providing details on what type of foul it was or whether it resulted in free throws.\n9.  Since there is no specific information about free throws in the visualization, the question cannot be answered.",
