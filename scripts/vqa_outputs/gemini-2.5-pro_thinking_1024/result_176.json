  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the number of times the event \"UMD Offense\" occurred immediately after the event \"UNC Offense\".\n2.  In the provided node-link diagram, this is represented by the directed link (arrow) that goes from the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n3.  I will locate the \"UNC Offense\" node in the diagram. It is positioned below the \"_Start\" node.\n4.  Next, I will locate the \"UMD Offense\" node. It is positioned further down in the diagram.\n5.  I will then trace the paths originating from the \"UNC Offense\" node. There are three such paths:\n    *   One path goes to the \"Made Shot\" node.\n    *   One path goes to the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   One path goes directly to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n6.  The question asks for the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\", so I need to find the value on the link connecting these two specific nodes.\n7.  The link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a numeric label \"23\" next to it.\n8.  This number represents the count of sequences where \"UMD Offense\" directly followed \"UNC Offense\".",
