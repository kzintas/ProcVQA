  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to find the total number of \"Rebound\" events shown in the node-link diagram.\n\n2.  **Scan the Diagram for \"Rebound\" Nodes:** I will look for all nodes with the label \"Rebound\". I have found two such nodes in the diagram.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First \"Rebound\" Node:**\n    *   This node appears on the right side of the diagram.\n    *   To determine how many sequences include this \"Rebound\" event, I will look at the value on the link leading *into* this node.\n    *   The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has the numerical label '15'. This indicates that there are 15 sequences where a \"UNC Offense\" is followed by a \"Rebound\".\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second \"Rebound\" Node:**\n    *   This node appears on the bottom-left side of the diagram.\n    *   I will examine the link leading *into* this node to find the number of sequences it represents.\n    *   The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has the numerical label '34'. This indicates that there are 34 sequences where a \"UMD Offense\" is followed by a \"Rebound\".\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** To find the total number of rebounds, I will sum the counts from all identified \"Rebound\" nodes.\n    *   Count from the first \"Rebound\" node: 15\n    *   Count from the second \"Rebound\" node: 34\n    *   Total rebounds = 15 + 34 = 49.",
