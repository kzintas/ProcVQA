  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks for the number of patients who died *after* arriving at 'Emergency'. I will start my analysis from the 'Emergency' node.\n2.  **Trace paths from 'Emergency':** From the 'Emergency' node, the diagram shows the flow splits into two paths:\n    *   A path to the 'ICU' node, taken by 62 patients.\n    *   A path to the 'Discharge-Alive' node, taken by 38 patients.\n3.  **Locate the 'Die' event:** The 'Die' event node is present in the diagram. I need to find the path that leads to this node from 'Emergency'.\n4.  **Follow the relevant path:** The 'Die' node is only reachable from the 'ICU' node. The sequence of events is `Emergency -> ICU -> Die`.\n5.  **Extract the count:** The number on the link connecting 'ICU' to 'Die' represents the number of patients who followed this path segment. The value on this link is 36.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, 36 patients who went to the 'ICU' after 'Emergency' subsequently died. The other path from 'Emergency' leads to 'Discharge-Alive' and does not involve the 'Die' event. So, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
