  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I start by locating the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  From the \"UMD Offense\" node, I trace the pathways to find any that lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n3.  There are three initial paths leaving \"UMD Offense\":\n    *   One path goes to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n    *   One path goes to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n    *   One path goes directly to \"_Exit\" with a count of 21.\n4.  I then examine the path that goes through \"Rebound\". From the \"Rebound\" node, there are two outgoing paths:\n    *   One path leads to the \"Made Shot\" node with a count of 15.\n    *   The other path leads to \"_Exit\" with a count of 19.\n5.  The path \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"Made Shot\" represents the sequences where UMD's offense resulted in a made shot. The number of such sequences is indicated by the value on the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", which is 15.\n6.  I check the other paths from \"UMD Offense\". The path to \"Missed Shot\" does not lead to a \"Made Shot\". The path to \"_Exit\" also does not lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n7.  Therefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is the number of sequences that follow the path to the \"Made Shot\" node, which is 15.",
