  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to find the total number of patients who were \"discharged alive\".\n2.  I need to locate all nodes labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram and sum the number of sequences (patients) that pass through them.\n3.  I can identify two distinct pathways that lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" event.\n4.  The first pathway is from the \"Emergency\" node directly to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The link for this path has a numeric label of 38. This means 38 patients were discharged alive from the emergency department.\n5.  The second pathway originates from the \"ICU\" node, goes to a \"Floor\" node, and then to another \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The link from \"Floor\" to this \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a numeric label of 24. This means 24 patients were discharged alive after being in the ICU and then on the floor.\n6.  To find the total number of patients discharged alive, I need to sum the counts from these two separate pathways.\n7.  Calculation: 38 (from Emergency) + 24 (from ICU -> Floor) = 62.",
