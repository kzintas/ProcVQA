  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  I then examine the links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node to see where the sequences go next.\n3.  There are two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":\n    *   One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node. The label on this link is 34. This means there were 34 sequences where \"UMD Offense\" was followed by \"Rebound\".\n    *   The other link goes to the \"_Exit\" node. The label on this link is 35. This represents all other sequences that passed through \"UMD Offense\" but did not transition to \"Rebound\".\n4.  The question asks how many times \"UMD Offense\" did *not* transition to a \"Rebound\". Based on the diagram, the only path from \"UMD Offense\" that isn't to \"Rebound\" is the path to \"_Exit\".\n5.  Therefore, the number of times \"UMD Offense\" did not transition to a \"Rebound\" is the count on the link leading to \"_Exit\", which is 35.",
