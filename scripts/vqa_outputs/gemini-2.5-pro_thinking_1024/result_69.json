After finding the \"ICU\" node, I will examine all the outgoing links to see where patients went next.\n4.  The diagram shows one single directed link leaving the \"ICU\" node.\n5.  This link points to the \"Die\" node, and it is labeled with the number 36.\n6.  There is no node labeled \"Floor\" in the diagram, and therefore, no link from \"ICU\" to a \"Floor\" node.\n7.  Based on the visualization, zero patients went to the \"Floor\" after the \"ICU\".",
