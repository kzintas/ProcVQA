  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I first identified the nodes mentioned in the question: `UNC Offense`, `Made Shot`, and `UMD Offense`.\n2.  I located the `UNC Offense` node in the diagram.\n3.  I followed the directed links originating from `UNC Offense`. There are two such links.\n4.  One link goes from `UNC Offense` to `Made Shot`, and another goes to `Missed Shot`.\n5.  The question specifically asks about \"made shots\". The link connecting `UNC Offense` to `Made Shot` represents the sequences where a made shot occurred immediately after a UNC offense.\n6.  The numeric label on this specific link is `22`.\n7.  I then checked the path *from* `Made Shot`. There is a link from `Made Shot` to `UMD Offense` with a value of `22`, confirming that these made shots occurred before the `UMD Offense`.\n8.  Therefore, the number of made shots that occurred after `UNC Offense` and before `UMD Offense` is the value on the link between `UNC Offense` and `Made Shot`, which is 22.",
