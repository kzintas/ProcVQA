  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The question asks about the number of \"Missed Shot\" events that occurred before \"UMD Offense\". This requires finding the \"Missed Shot\" node and the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Locate the nodes:** The \"Missed Shot\" node is located on the right side of the diagram. The \"UMD Offense\" node is located below it, in the center.\n3.  **Trace the path:** The diagram shows a directed link (pathway) originating from the \"Missed Shot\" node and pointing downwards to the \"UMD Offense\" node. This indicates a sequence where a \"Missed Shot\" event is followed by a \"UMD Offense\" event.\n4.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label on the link connecting \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" explicitly states the number of sequences that follow this path.\n5.  **Extract the count:** The value on this link is 24. This means there were 24 instances where a \"Missed Shot\" was immediately followed by \"UMD Offense\".",
