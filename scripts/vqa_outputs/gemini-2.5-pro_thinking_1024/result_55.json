  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the \"Emergency\" node in the diagram. It is positioned below the \"Arrival\" node.\n2.  Next, I examine the directed links (pathways) that originate from the \"Emergency\" node.\n3.  I observe three outgoing links from \"Emergency\":\n    *   One link goes to the \"Floor\" node with a value of 21.\n    *   One link goes to the \"ICU\" node with a value of 41.\n    *   One link goes directly to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  The question asks for the number of patients discharged alive *directly after* an Emergency. This corresponds to the link connecting the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n5.  I read the numeric label on this specific link, which is 38. This number represents the count of sequences following this path.",
