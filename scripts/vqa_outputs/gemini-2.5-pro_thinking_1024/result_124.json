  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks for an event that happens immediately after \"UMD Offense\". I will locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify the target node:** The question is about the number of \"Missed Shot\" events. I will look for nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\".\n3.  **Trace the path:** I will trace the directed links (paths) that originate from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n4.  **Find the specific path:** I will look for the specific link that goes directly from the \"UMD Offense\" node to a \"Missed Shot\" node.\n5.  **Read the value:** The diagram shows a link going from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\". The numeric label on this link is 14. This number represents the count of sequences following this specific path.",
