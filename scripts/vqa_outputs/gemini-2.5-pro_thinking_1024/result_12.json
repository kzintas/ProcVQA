  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks for patients who arrived at \"Emergency\". I will start tracing the pathways from the \"Emergency\" node.\n2.  **Identify the end point:** The question asks for the number of patients who \"died\". I need to find the pathways from \"Emergency\" that lead to the \"Die\" node.\n3.  **Trace the pathways:**\n    *   All 100 sequences start at `_Start`, pass through `Arrival`, and reach `Emergency`.\n    *   From the \"Emergency\" node, the path splits. 62 sequences go to the \"ICU\" node, and 38 sequences go to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n    *   To find the patients who died, I must follow the path that leads to the \"Die\" node.\n    *   The path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" does not lead to \"Die\".\n    *   The path from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" is the only one that can potentially lead to \"Die\".\n    *   From the \"ICU\" node, the path splits again. One of these paths leads to the \"Die\" node.\n    *   The link connecting \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has a numeric label of 36.\n4.  **Conclusion:** This means that out of the 62 patients who went from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\", 36 of them subsequently followed the path to \"Die\". Therefore, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
