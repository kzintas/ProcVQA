  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "19",

  "reasoning": "1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to know the total count of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur after a \"UNC Offense\" event and before a \"UMD Offense\" event. This requires finding all pathways in the diagram that follow the sequence: `UNC Offense` -> ... -> `Missed Shot` -> ... -> `UMD Offense`.\n\n2.  **Examine the diagram's pathways:** The visualization displays four distinct vertical pathways. I will inspect each one to see if it contains the required sequence and count the occurrences.\n\n3.  **Pathway 1 (far left):**\n    *   This pathway starts with `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2).\n    *   From `UNC Offense`, one branch leads to `Missed Shot` (2).\n    *   However, following the `Missed Shot` node, the sequence continues to `Made Shot` (2) and then `_Exit` (2).\n    *   There is no `UMD Offense` node in this pathway. Therefore, this pathway contributes 0 to the total count.\n\n4.  **Pathway 2 (second from left):**\n    *   This pathway starts with `_Start` (19) -> `UNC Offense` (19).\n    *   From `UNC Offense`, one branch leads to `Missed Shot` (19).\n    *   Following the `Missed Shot` (19) node, the pathway continues to `UMD Offense` (17).\n    *   This pathway matches the required sequence: `UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense`.\n    *   The numeric label next to this `Missed Shot` node is 19. This means 19 sequences include this specific event.\n    *   Therefore, this pathway contributes 19 to the total count.\n\n5.  **Pathway 3 (third from left):**\n    *   This pathway starts with `_Start` (33) -> `UNC Offense` (33).\n    *   Following `UNC Offense`, the sequence proceeds to `Made Shot` (28), then `UMD Offense` (26). This branch does not contain a `Missed Shot`.\n    *   There is another branch after `UMD Offense` (26) that leads to `Missed Shot` (18). However, this `Missed Shot` occurs *after* `UMD Offense`, not before.\n    *   Therefore, this pathway contributes 0 to the total count.\n\n6.  **Pathway 4 (far right):**\n    *   This pathway starts with `_Start` (15) -> `UNC Offense` (15).\n    *   The sequence then proceeds to `Foul` (15) and then to `UMD Offense` (11).\n    *   This pathway does not contain a `Missed Shot` node at all.\n    *   Therefore, this pathway contributes 0 to the total count.\n\n7.  **Calculate the total:** To find the total number of missed shots that fit the criteria, I sum the counts from all relevant pathways.\n    *   Pathway 1: 0\n    *   Pathway 2: 19\n    *   Pathway 3: 0\n    *   Pathway 4: 0\n    *   Total = 0 + 19 + 0 + 0 = 19.",
