This link originates from the `Emergency` node.\n3.  The numeric label on the link connecting `Emergency` to `Discharge-Alive` indicates the number of sequences (patients) that followed this path.\n4.  The value explicitly shown on this link is 38.\n5.  There are no other pathways leading to the `Discharge-Alive` node.\n6.  Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.",
