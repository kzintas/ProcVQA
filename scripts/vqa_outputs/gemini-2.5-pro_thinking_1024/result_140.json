  "reasoning": "1.  **Locate the 'UMD Offense' node:** I first find the node labeled 'UMD Offense' in the diagram. It is located below the 'UNC Offense' node.\n2.  **Examine the outgoing links:** I look at the directed links originating from the 'UMD Offense' node. There are three such links.\n3.  **Identify the relevant link:** The question asks for the number of shots that were *missed* immediately after 'UMD Offense'. I need to find the link that connects the 'UMD Offense' node to the 'Missed Shot' node.\n4.  **Read the value on the link:** I trace the path from 'UMD Offense' to 'Missed Shot' and find the numeric label associated with this link. The value on this link is 14. This number represents the count of sequences where a 'Missed Shot' event directly followed a 'UMD Offense' event.",
