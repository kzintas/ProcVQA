  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The user wants to know the number of patients who were discharged alive immediately after being in Emergency.\n2.  I need to find a direct pathway from an 'Emergency' node to a 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n3.  I will examine each of the four vertical pathways presented in the visualization.\n4.  The first pathway (far left) shows `Emergency` -> `ICU`.\n5.  The second pathway (from the left) shows `Emergency` -> `Discharge-Alive`. The numeric label for this path is 37. This directly answers the question.\n6.  The third pathway (from the left) shows `Emergency` -> `ICU`.\n7.  The fourth pathway (far right) shows `Emergency` -> `Floor`.\n8.  Based on the analysis, only the second pathway shows patients being discharged alive directly from Emergency. The count for this specific sequence is 37.",
