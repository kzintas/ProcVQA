  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to find the number of sequences where a 'Missed Shot' event occurred immediately before the 'UMD Offense' event.\n\n2.  **Locate Relevant Nodes:** I will find all nodes labeled 'Missed Shot' and the node labeled 'UMD Offense' in the diagram.\n    *   There is a 'Missed Shot' node in the upper half of the diagram, following 'UNC Offense'.\n    *   There is a 'UMD Offense' node in the middle of the diagram.\n    *   There is another 'Missed Shot' node in the lower half, following 'UMD Offense'.\n\n3.  **Analyze Chronology:** The question asks for events *before* 'UMD Offense'. The diagram's vertical layout shows chronological order from top to bottom. Therefore, I need to look at the 'Missed Shot' node that is located above the 'UMD Offense' node.\n\n4.  **Trace the Path:** I will trace the directed link (arrow) that goes from the 'Missed Shot' node (the one following 'UNC Offense') to the 'UMD Offense' node.\n\n5.  **Read the Value:** The numeric label on the link connecting 'Missed Shot' to 'UMD Offense' is 24. This number represents the count of sequences that followed this specific path.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, there were 24 missed shots that occurred immediately before 'UMD Offense'.",
