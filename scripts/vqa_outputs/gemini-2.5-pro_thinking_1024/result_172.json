This means there were 15 rebounds following a UNC Offense.\n    *   I found a second 'Rebound' node in the bottom half of the diagram, following the 'UMD Offense' node.\n    *   To find the number of times this event occurred, I look at the incoming link.\n    *   There is a link from 'UMD Offense' to this 'Rebound' node.\n    *   The numeric label on this link is '8'. This means there were 8 rebounds following a UMD Offense.\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** To get the total number of rebounds, I will sum the counts from all 'Rebound' nodes found.\n    *   Total Rebounds = (Rebounds after UNC Offense) + (Rebounds after UMD Offense)\n    *   Total Rebounds = 15 + 8 = 23.",
