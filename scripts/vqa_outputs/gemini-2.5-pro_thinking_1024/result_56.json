  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Start Node:** The question asks for the number of patients who went to the ICU *after* the \"Emergency\" event. Therefore, the starting point for our analysis is the \"Emergency\" node.\n\n2.  **Trace Outgoing Paths from \"Emergency\":** From the \"Emergency\" node, there are three distinct paths leading to subsequent events:\n    *   A path to the \"Floor\" node.\n    *   A path to the \"ICU\" node.\n    *   A path to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n3.  **Identify Paths Leading to \"ICU\":** We need to find all sequences where a patient is in \"Emergency\" and their next event is \"ICU\".\n    *   There is a direct link from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"ICU\" node. The numeric label on this link is 41. This represents 41 patients who went directly from Emergency to the ICU.\n    *   There is another path from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" with a count of 21. From this \"Floor\" node, there is a path to \"ICU\" also with a count of 21. This means 21 patients followed the sequence Emergency -> Floor -> ICU.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** To find the total number of patients who went to the ICU at any point after being in Emergency, we must sum the counts of all pathways from \"Emergency\" that lead to \"ICU\".\n    *   Patients going directly from Emergency to ICU: 41\n    *   Patients going from Emergency to Floor and then to ICU: 21\n    *   Total = 41 + 21 = 62.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** By summing the number of patients from the two distinct pathways originating at \"Emergency\" and leading to \"ICU\", we find the total count.",
