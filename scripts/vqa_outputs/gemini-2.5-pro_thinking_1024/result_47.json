  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at 'Emergency'. I will start by locating the 'Emergency' node.\n2.  **Trace all paths from 'Emergency':** From the 'Emergency' node, there are three distinct paths:\n    *   A path to 'Discharge-Alive' with a count of 38.\n    *   A path to 'Floor' with a count of 21.\n    *   A path to 'ICU' with a count of 41.\n3.  **Follow each path to find which ones lead to the 'Die' node:**\n    *   The path 'Emergency' -> 'Discharge-Alive' (38 patients) leads to '_Exit'. These patients did not die.\n    *   The path 'Emergency' -> 'Floor' (21 patients) continues to 'ICU'. From this 'ICU' node, one path goes to 'Die'.\n    *   The path 'Emergency' -> 'ICU' (41 patients) also leads to the same 'ICU' node, from which one path goes to 'Die'.\n4.  **Identify the 'Die' node and its incoming link:** The 'Die' node is located towards the bottom of the diagram. It has only one incoming link, which originates from the 'ICU' node.\n5.  **Read the value on the link leading to 'Die':** The numeric label on the link from 'ICU' to 'Die' is 36. This number represents the total count of sequences (patients) that followed this specific path segment.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since all paths that lead to 'Die' must pass through the 'ICU' -> 'Die' link, the number on this link represents the total number of patients who died. These patients all came from 'Emergency' originally, either directly to 'ICU' or via 'Floor' to 'ICU'. Therefore, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
