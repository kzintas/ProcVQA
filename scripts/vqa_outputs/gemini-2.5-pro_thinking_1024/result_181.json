  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  First, I locate the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the provided node-link diagram.\n2.  Next, I examine all the outgoing links (paths) that originate from the \"UMD Offense\" node to identify the subsequent events.\n3.  The diagram shows two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":\n    *   One link points to the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   The other link points to the \"_Exit\" node.\n4.  The question asks for the number of \"steals\" that occurred after \"UMD Offense\".\n5.  I scan the diagram for any node labeled \"Steal\" that is directly connected by a link from \"UMD Offense\".\n6.  There is no node labeled \"Steal\" shown in the diagram, and therefore, no link from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Steal\" node.\n7.  Based on the explicit information presented in the visualization, there were zero instances of a \"Steal\" event following a \"UMD Offense\" event. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the visualization. The diagram does not show any event called 'Steal', so we cannot know if steals happened or not.",
