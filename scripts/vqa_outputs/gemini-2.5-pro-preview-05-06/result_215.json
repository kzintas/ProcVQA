  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense. To answer this, I need to find all instances of the \"Made Free Throw\" event that can be attributed to \"UMD Offense\". This means looking for sequences where \"UMD Offense\" is in possession and then a \"Made Free Throw\" event occurs, or where a \"Made Free Throw\" event is otherwise clearly linked to UMD Offense making the shot.\n\n1.  **Identify \"Made Free Throw\" events:**\n    I will scan the entire node-link diagram for any nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\".\n    *   In the third column (which starts with \"_Start 15\"), there are two \"Made Free Throw\" nodes:\n        *   One labeled \"Made Free Throw\" with an associated count of 13.\n        *   Another one below it, also labeled \"Made Free Throw\", with an associated count of 8.\n    *   There are no other \"Made Free Throw\" nodes in any other part of the diagram.\n\n2.  **Determine which team made these free throws:**\n    To attribute these free throws, I need to look at the sequence of events leading up to them in that third column.\n    The sequence is:\n    _Start (15) -> UNC Offense (15) -> Foul (15) -> Made Free Throw (13) -> Made Free Throw (8) -> UMD Offense (8) -> _Exit (15).\n    *   \"UNC Offense (15)\" indicates that UNC (University of North Carolina) had possession of the ball.\n    *   \"Foul (15)\" occurs while UNC is on offense. In basketball, this typically means the defending team committed a foul against UNC. Therefore, UNC would be the team to shoot the resulting free throws.\n    *   The events \"Made Free Throw (13)\" and \"Made Free Throw (8)\" immediately follow the \"Foul\". This strongly suggests these free throws were made by UNC Offense. The first indicates 13 made free throws (or free throws made in 13 sequences), and the second indicates 8 further made free throws (or free throws made in 8 of those sequences, e.g., a second shot).\n    *   \"UMD Offense (8)\" occurs *after* these \"Made Free Throw\" events. This means UMD (University of Maryland) gained possession of the ball only *after* UNC had taken and made these free throws.\n    *   Therefore, the 13 and 8 made free throws shown in this column were made by UNC Offense, not UMD Offense.\n\n3.  **Check if UMD Offense leads to any \"Made Free Throw\" events elsewhere:**\n    I will examine all instances of \"UMD Offense\" and see what event follows it.\n    *   **Column 1 (_Start 7):** ... -> UMD Offense (7) -> Rebound (7) -> ...\n        *   Here, UMD Offense is followed by \"Rebound\". No \"Made Free Throw\" by UMD.\n    *   **Column 2 (_Start 14):** ... -> UMD Offense (13) -> Rebound (11) -> ...\n        *   Here, UMD Offense is followed by \"Rebound\". No \"Made Free Throw\" by UMD.\n    *   **Column 3 (_Start 15):** As analyzed above, UMD Offense (8) occurs *after* the free throws made by UNC and is followed by _Exit. No \"Made Free Throw\" by UMD.\n    *   **Column 4 (_Start 5):** ... -> UMD Offense (5) -> Made Shot (4) -> ...\n        *   Here, UMD Offense is followed by \"Made Shot\". No \"Made Free Throw\" by UMD.\n    *   **Column 5 (_Start 28):** ... -> UMD Offense (12) -> Missed Shot (7) -> ...\n        *   Here, UMD Offense is followed by \"Missed Shot\". No \"Made Free Throw\" by UMD.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the examination of all \"Made Free Throw\" events and all sequences involving \"UMD Offense\", there are no instances in the diagram where UMD Offense makes a free throw. The only \"Made Free Throw\" events depicted were made by UNC Offense.\n\nTherefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, according to the provided visualization, is 0.",
