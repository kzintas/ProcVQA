  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of missed shots that occur *after* \"UNC Offense\" but *before* \"UMD Offense\". This means we need to find sequences of events that follow the pattern: UNC Offense -> ... -> Missed Shot -> ... -> UMD Offense. We then sum the number of sequences that follow such paths, counting the \"Missed Shot\" event.\n\nLet's examine each column of the diagram:\n\n1.  **Column 1 (starts with _Start 2):**\n    *   The path is: _Start (2) -> UNC Offense (2) -> Missed Shot (2) -> Made Shot (2) -> _Exit (2).\n    *   Here, \"Missed Shot\" (2 instances) occurs after \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   However, \"UMD Offense\" does not occur after \"Missed Shot\" in this path. The path ends with \"Made Shot\" and then \"_Exit\".\n    *   Therefore, these 2 missed shots do not satisfy the condition \"before UMD Offense\" (as UMD Offense doesn't follow).\n    *   Contribution from this column: 0.\n\n2.  **Column 2 (starts with _Start 13):**\n    *   The path is: _Start (13) -> UNC Offense (13) -> Foul (13) -> Made Free Throw (12).\n    *   From \"Made Free Throw (12)\", 9 sequences go to \"UMD Offense (9)\" and 3 sequences go to \"Foul (3)\".\n    *   Path 1 (9 sequences): UNC Offense -> Foul -> Made Free Throw -> UMD Offense. This path contains \"UNC Offense\" followed by \"UMD Offense\", but there is no \"Missed Shot\" event occurring between them.\n    *   Path 2 (3 sequences): UNC Offense -> Foul -> Made Free Throw -> Foul. This path does not contain \"UMD Offense\" after \"Made Free Throw\".\n    *   Therefore, there are no missed shots in this column that satisfy the condition.\n    *   Contribution from this column: 0.\n\n3.  **Column 3 (starts with _Start 26):**\n    *   The path is: _Start (26) -> UNC Offense (26) -> Rebound (26) -> Missed Shot (25).\n    *   This means 25 sequences follow the path UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot.\n    *   From the \"Missed Shot (25)\" node, there is an outgoing link to \"UMD Offense (20)\".\n    *   This indicates that 20 sequences continue as: UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense.\n    *   In these 20 sequences, the \"Missed Shot\" event occurs *after* \"UNC Offense\" and *before* \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   The remaining 5 sequences (25 - 20 = 5) that pass through \"Missed Shot (25)\" are not shown to proceed to \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, these 5 do not satisfy the full condition.\n    *   Contribution from this column: 20.\n\n4.  **Column 4 (starts with _Start 21):**\n    *   The path is: _Start (21) -> UNC Offense (21) -> Made Shot (20).\n    *   From \"Made Shot (20)\", 18 sequences go to \"UMD Offense (18)\".\n    *   Path (18 sequences): UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense.

This implies a path segment: UMD Offense -> Missed Shot for 12 sequences.\n    *   So, for these 12 sequences, the full path would be: UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense -> Missed Shot.\n    *   In this case, the \"Missed Shot\" occurs *after* \"UMD Offense\", not before. Thus, these do not count.\n    *   Contribution from this column: 0.\n\n5.  **Column 5 (starts with _Start 7):**\n    *   The path is: _Start (7) -> UNC Offense (7).\n    *   From \"UNC Offense (7)\", 4 sequences go to \"Turnover (4)\".\n    *   Below \"Turnover (4)\" is \"UMD Offense (7)\".
