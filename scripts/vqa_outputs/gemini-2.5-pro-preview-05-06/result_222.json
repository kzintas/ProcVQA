  "reasoning": "The user is asking for the number of free throws made by UMD Offense based on the provided node-link diagram.\n\n1.  **Identify \"Made Free Throw\" Events:**\n    The diagram shows one node labeled \"Made Free Throw\" with an associated value of 12 (let's call this MFT12). This means there were 12 instances of made free throws recorded in this part of the sequence.\n\n2.  **Determine Who Made These 12 Free Throws:**\n    To determine which team made these free throws, we need to look at the context:\n    *   The MFT12 node is preceded by `_Start (13) -> UNC Offense (13) -> Foul (13)`. This indicates that UNC was on offense, and a foul occurred.\n    *   Typically, if a team is on offense and a foul leads to free throws, it's because the *defending* team committed the foul, and the team on *offense* shoots the free throws. So, UNC Offense -> Foul (by UMD) -> Made Free Throw (by UNC).\n    *   Critically, let's examine what happens *after* the MFT12 event. The MFT12 node has outgoing links to:\n        *   `UMD Offense (9)`: 9 sequences proceed to UMD having offensive possession.\n        *   `Foul (3)`: 3 sequences proceed to a Foul event.\n    *   In basketball, after a team (Team A) makes free throws, the opposing team (Team B) typically inbounds the ball and gains offensive possession.\n    *   The sequence `Made Free Throw (12) -> UMD Offense (9)` strongly implies that the team that made the free throws was *UNC*, and consequently, UMD gained possession. If UMD had made the free throws, UNC would have gained possession next, which is not what the diagram shows as the primary path (9 sequences).\n\n    Therefore, the 12 \"Made Free Throw\" events are attributed to UNC, not UMD.\n\n3.  **Look for Other Instances of UMD Making Free Throws:**\n    We need to search for any other \"Made Free Throw\" events or sequences where UMD Offense is fouled and then makes free throws.\n    *   Consider the path originating from MFT12 (made by UNC):\n        *   `Made Free Throw (by UNC, 12) -> UMD Offense (9)`. Now UMD is on offense for 9 sequences.\n            *   From `UMD Offense (9)`, there's an outgoing link to `Foul (3)`. This means that in 3 of these sequences where UMD was on offense, a foul occurred. Since UMD was on offense, this foul was likely committed by UNC (defense). This situation *should* lead to UMD attempting free throws.\n        *   `Made Free Throw (by UNC, 12) -> Foul (3)`. This means that in 3 sequences, immediately after UNC made free throws (and UMD would be taking possession), a foul occurred. Again, UMD would be the team on offense (or about to be), so this foul was likely committed by UNC against UMD. This situation *should* also lead to UMD attempting free throws.\n    *   The `Foul (3)` node is the recipient of these sequences. However, looking at the diagram, this `Foul (3)` node does *not* have an outgoing link to any \"Made Free Throw\" node. It appears to lead to `_Exit` (implied as it's at the end of that path segment in the column).\n    *   This means that while there were 3 instances where UMD was on offense and a foul occurred (which should result in free throw attempts by UMD), the diagram does *not explicitly show* these attempts resulting in \"Made Free Throw\" events for UMD.\n\n4.  **Conclusion Based Solely on Visualization:**\n    *   The only \"Made Free Throw\" event explicitly shown in the diagram (MFT12) is attributed to UNC based on the subsequent possession change.\n    *   Situations where UMD was fouled while on offense (totaling 3 instances leading to the \"Foul (3)\" node) do not lead to a \"Made Free Throw\" node in this diagram.\n    *   Since the question asks for how many free throws were *made* by UMD Offense, and the diagram does not show any \"Made Free Throw\" events attributable to UMD, the answer must be 0.\n\nThe instructions state to answer \"solely based on what is explicitly shown\". The diagram explicitly shows one \"Made Free Throw\" event (12 occurrences), and the context (possession following the FTs) indicates these were made by UNC. There are no other \"Made Free Throw\" events shown, particularly none following fouls committed against UMD when UMD was on offense.",
