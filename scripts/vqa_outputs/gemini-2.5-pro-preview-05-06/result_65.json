  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.\n2.  First, identify the \"Emergency\" node in the diagram.\n3.  Trace the pathways originating from the \"Emergency\" node that lead to a \"Die\" node.\n4.  From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to \"ICU\" with a value of 62. This means 62 sequences (patients) went from Emergency to ICU.\n    *   Another link goes to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a value of 38. This means 38 sequences (patients) went from Emergency to Discharge-Alive.\n5.  Now, trace the pathways from these subsequent nodes to see if they lead to \"Die\".\n    *   From \"ICU\", there is one outgoing link to \"Die\" with a value of 36. This means 36 sequences (patients) who were in ICU subsequently died.\n    *   From \"Discharge-Alive\", there is one outgoing link to \"_Exit\" with a value of 38. This path does not lead to \"Die\".\n6.  Therefore, the sequence of events for patients who died after Emergency is: Emergency -> ICU -> Die.\n7.  The number of patients following the path from ICU to Die is explicitly given as 36. Since all patients who reached ICU came from Emergency (as per the flow starting from Emergency and leading to ICU), these 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency and subsequently being admitted to ICU.\n8.  The number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the number of patients who followed the path segment leading to \"Die\" that originates from a path starting at \"Emergency\". In this case, it is the 36 patients who went from \"ICU\" to \"Die\".",
