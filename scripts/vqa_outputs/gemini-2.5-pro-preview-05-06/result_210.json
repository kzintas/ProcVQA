  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" event occurred immediately after a \"UNC Offense\" event.\n2.  I need to scan the diagram for sequences where a \"UNC Offense\" node is directly linked to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n3.  I will examine each column that contains \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   **First column (starts with \"_Start 7\"):** \"_Start\" (7) -> \"UNC Offense\" (7). The next event after \"UNC Offense\" is \"Missed Shot\" (7). No \"Jump Ball\" here.\n    *   **Second column (starts with \"_Start 14\"):** \"_Start\" (14) -> \"UNC Offense\" (14). The next event after \"UNC Offense\" is \"Rebound\" (14). No \"Jump Ball\" here.\n    *   **Third column (starts with \"_Start 15\"):** \"_Start\" (15) -> \"UNC Offense\" (15). The next event after \"UNC Offense\" is \"Foul\" (15). No \"Jump Ball\" here.\n    *   **Fourth column (starts with \"_Start 5\"):** \"_Start\" (5) -> \"UNC Offense\" (5). From this \"UNC Offense\" node, there is a link to \"Jump Ball\" with the numeric label \"1\" next to the link. This indicates that the sequence \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Jump Ball\" occurred 1 time in this pathway.\n    *   **Fifth column (starts with \"_Start 28\"):** \"_Start\" (28) -> \"UNC Offense\" (28). The next event after \"UNC Offense\" is \"Rebound\" (18). No \"Jump Ball\" here.\n4.  By examining all instances of \"UNC Offense\", I found one pathway where \"UNC Offense\" is directly followed by \"Jump Ball\". The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Jump Ball\" in the fourth column has a value of 1.\n5.  Therefore, a jump ball occurred 1 time after UNC Offense.",
