So, the starting node for this query is \"Emergency\".\n2.  **Locate the \"Emergency\" node:** The \"Emergency\" node is clearly visible in the diagram.\n3.  **Identify outgoing links from \"Emergency\":** From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to the \"ICU\" node.\n    *   Another link goes to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  **Identify the target node:** The question asks how many patients went to the \"ICU\".\n5.  **Find the specific link:** We are interested in the link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\".\n6.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label next to the link connecting \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" is 62. This represents the number of sequences (patients) following that path.",
