  "question": "How many Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about Rebounds made *by* UMD Offense, which means we need to find sequences that start with \"UMD Offense\" and lead to \"Rebound\".\n2.  **Locate \"UMD Offense\" node:** The node labeled \"UMD Offense\" is present in the diagram.\n3.  **Examine outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   Another link goes to the \"_Exit\" node.\n4.  **Identify the relevant link:** We are interested in the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n5.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is 34. This indicates that 34 sequences followed this specific path.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, there were 34 instances where a \"Rebound\" event occurred immediately after a \"UMD Offense\" event.",
