  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  Identify the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  Observe the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node and their corresponding values:\n    *   A link goes from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a value of 34.\n    *   A link goes from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" with a value of 14.\n    *   A link goes from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" with a value of 21.\n3.  The question asks how many times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound.\n4.  This means we need to count the sequences that started at \"UMD Offense\" and went to any node *other than* \"Rebound\".\n5.  The transitions from \"UMD Offense\" to nodes other than \"Rebound\" are:\n    *   \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\": 14 times.\n    *   \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\": 21 times.\n6.  Sum these values: 14 + 21 = 35.\n7.  Alternatively, we can find the total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" by summing all outgoing links: 34 (to Rebound) + 14 (to Missed Shot) + 21 (to _Exit) = 69. The number of sequences transitioning to \"Rebound\" is 34. So, the number of sequences not transitioning to \"Rebound\" is 69 - 34 = 35. Both methods yield the same result.",
