  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of missed shots that occur after a \"UNC Offense\" event but not after a \"UMD Offense\" event. This means we are looking for paths of the form `UNC Offense -> ... -> Missed Shot`, where the sequence of events \"...\" does not contain a \"UMD Offense\" node. The vertical position indicates chronological order (top to bottom). Link labels show the count of sequences following that path.\n\nLet's analyze each column (sequence group) in the diagram:\n\n**Column 1 (Starts with 7 sequences):**\n1.  The path starts `_Start (7) -> UNC Offense (7)`.\n2.  From `UNC Offense (7)`, there's a direct link to `Missed Shot (7)`. The number of sequences is 7.\n    - Path segment: `UNC Offense -> Missed Shot`.\n    - \"UNC Offense\" is before \"Missed Shot\".\n    - There is no \"UMD Offense\" node on the path *between* this \"UNC Offense\" and this \"Missed Shot\".\n    - Therefore, these 7 \"Missed Shot\" events count.\n3.  Later in this column, the path continues: `... -> Missed Shot (7) -> UMD Offense (7) -> Rebound (7) -> Missed Shot (6)`.\n    - For this second `Missed Shot (6)`, the path from the initial `UNC Offense (7)` is `UNC Offense (7) -> Missed Shot (7) -> UMD Offense (7) -> Rebound (7) -> Missed Shot (6)`.\n    - This path contains `UMD Offense (7)` *before* `Missed Shot (6)`.\n    - Therefore, this `Missed Shot (6)` does not count towards the total.\n    Contribution from Column 1 = 7.\n\n**Column 2 (Starts with 14 sequences):**\n1.  The path starts `_Start (14) -> UNC Offense (14)`.\n2.  From `UNC Offense (14)`, the path goes `UNC Offense (14) -> Rebound (14) -> Missed Shot (14)`. The number of sequences is 14.\n    - Path segment from `UNC Offense` to `Missed Shot`: `UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot`.\n    - \"UNC Offense\" is before \"Missed Shot\".\n    - The intermediate event is \"Rebound\", which is not \"UMD Offense\". There is no \"UMD Offense\" node on the path *between* this \"UNC Offense\" and this \"Missed Shot\".\n    - Therefore, these 14 \"Missed Shot\" events count.\n3.  Later events in this column include `UMD Offense (13)`.\n    Contribution from Column 2 = 14.\n\n**Column 3 (Starts with 15 sequences):**\n1.  The path starts `_Start (15) -> UNC Offense (15)`.\n2.  The path continues: `UNC Offense (15) -> Foul (15) -> Made Free Throw (13) -> Made Free Throw (8) -> UMD Offense (8)`.\n3.  There are no \"Missed Shot\" nodes on this path *before* the `UMD Offense (8)` node. Any \"Missed Shot\" occurring after `UMD Offense (8)` would not count.\n    Contribution from Column 3 = 0.\n\n**Column 4 (Starts with 5 sequences):**\n1.  The path starts `_Start (5) -> UNC Offense (5)`.\n2.  From `UNC Offense (5)`, there are two explicitly labeled outgoing links:\n    - Path A: `UNC Offense -> Jump Ball (1)`. The visual line from `Jump Ball` points to `UMD Offense`. So this path segment becomes `UNC Offense -> Jump Ball -> UMD Offense`. Any \"Missed Shot\" after this `UMD Offense` would not count. There is no \"Missed Shot\" shown on this path segment before `UMD Offense`.\n    - Path B: `UNC Offense -> UMD Offense (5)`. Any \"Missed Shot\" after this `UMD Offense` would not count. There is no \"Missed Shot\" shown on this path segment before `UMD Offense`.\n3.  In both potential paths originating from `UNC Offense (5)`, the event `UMD Offense` is encountered before any (unshown) subsequent \"Missed Shot\".\n    Contribution from Column 4 = 0.\n\n**Column 5 (Starts with 28 sequences):**\n1.  The path starts `_Start (28) -> UNC Offense (28)`.\n2.  From `UNC Offense (28)`:\n    - One explicit link goes `UNC Offense (28) -> Rebound (18)`. (18 sequences)\n        - From `Rebound (18)`, an explicit link goes `Rebound (18) -> Made Shot (16)`. This path is `UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Made Shot`. No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n        - This leaves 18 - 16 = 2 sequences from `Rebound (18)`. Chronologically (vertically), the next significant node in this column for these sequences would be `UMD Offense (12)`, which appears before `Missed Shot (7)`. So if these 2 sequences lead to a \"Missed Shot (7)\", it would be via the path `UNC Offense -> Rebound -> UMD Offense -> Missed Shot`. This \"Missed Shot\" would be after \"UMD Offense\" and thus not count.\n    - The remaining 28 - 18 = 10 sequences from `UNC Offense (28)` are not routed by an explicit link with a count to `Rebound`. These 10 sequences would flow downwards from `UNC Offense (28)`.\n        - Chronologically (vertically), these 10 sequences would encounter `UMD Offense (12)` *before* encountering `Missed Shot (7)`.\n        - So, any \"Missed Shot (7)\" resulting from these 10 sequences would be via a path like `UNC Offense -> UMD Offense -> Missed Shot`. This \"Missed Shot\" would be after \"UMD Offense\" and thus not count.\n3.  The node `Missed Shot (7)` in this column appears chronologically after `UMD Offense (12)`. Therefore, any path from `UNC Offense (28)` to this `Missed Shot (7)` must pass through `UMD Offense (12)` first (or through `Rebound` then `UMD Offense`).\n    Contribution from Column 5 = 0.\n\n**Total Calculation:**\nSumming the contributions from all columns:\nTotal = (Contribution from Column 1) + (Contribution from Column 2) + (Contribution from Column 3) + (Contribution from Column 4) + (Contribution from Column 5)\nTotal = 7 + 14 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 21.",
