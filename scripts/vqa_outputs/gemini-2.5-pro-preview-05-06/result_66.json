  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive.\n2.  I need to locate the node representing \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram.\n3.  The diagram shows a node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4.  There is an incoming link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a numeric label of 38. This means 38 sequences (patients) reached the \"Discharge-Alive\" state from \"Emergency\".\n5.  There is an outgoing link from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\" with a numeric label of 38. This means 38 sequences (patients) transitioned from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\".\n6.  Since the incoming and outgoing link counts for \"Discharge-Alive\" are both 38, this confirms that 38 patients were discharged alive.",
