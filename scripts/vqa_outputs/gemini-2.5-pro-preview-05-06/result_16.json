  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about patients going to the \"Floor\" *after* the \"ICU\". So, the starting node of interest is \"ICU\".\n2.  **Locate the \"ICU\" node:** The \"ICU\" node is present in the diagram.\n3.  **Identify outgoing links from \"ICU\":** From the \"ICU\" node, there are three outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to the \"Die\" node, with a numeric label of 36.\n    *   One link goes to the \"Floor\" node, with a numeric label of 24.\n    *   One link goes to the \"\\_Exit\" node, with a numeric label of 2.\n4.  **Find the specific path:** The question asks for the number of patients who went to the \"Floor\" after the \"ICU\". This corresponds to the link from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\".\n5.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label on the link from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" is 24. This represents the number of sequences (patients) following that path.",
