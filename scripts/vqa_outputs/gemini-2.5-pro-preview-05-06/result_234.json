  "reasoning": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the total number of \"Made Shot\" events by both teams, based on the provided node-link diagram.\n\n2.  **Identify \"Made Shot\" Nodes and Their Counts:** I need to scan the diagram for all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" and find the numeric value associated directly with each of these nodes. These numeric values, often next to a colored bar representing the event, indicate the frequency of that event in the context of the sequence(s) shown in that part of the diagram.\n\n    *   **First Column (leftmost):**\n        *   There is a node labeled \"Made Shot\".\n        *   The numeric value associated with this node is \"2\" (explicitly \"Made Shot | 2\").\n        *   This \"Made Shot\" follows \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Missed Shot\", so it's a UNC made shot.\n        *   Count = 2.\n\n    *   **Second Column:**\n        *   Tracing down: \"\\_Start\" -> \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"Missed Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Rebound\".\n        *   Following this \"Rebound\" (which has a value of 15), there is a node labeled \"Made Shot\".\n        *   The numeric value associated with this \"Made Shot\" node is \"8\".\n        *   This \"Made Shot\" follows \"UMD Offense\", so it's a UMD made shot.\n        *   Count = 8.\n\n    *   **Third Column:**\n        *   Contains \"Made Free Throw\" but no \"Made Shot\".\n\n    *   **Fourth Column:**\n        *   Contains \"Turnover\" but no \"Made Shot\".\n\n    *   **Fifth Column (rightmost):**\n        *   Tracing down: \"\\_Start\" -> \"UNC Offense\".\n        *   Following this \"UNC Offense\", there is a node labeled \"Made Shot\".\n        *   The numeric value associated with this \"Made Shot\" node is \"20\".\n        *   This \"Made Shot\" follows \"UNC Offense\", so it's a UNC made shot.\n        *   Count = 20.\n\n3.  **Exclude Other Event Types:** The question specifically asks for \"Made Shot\". Events like \"Made Free Throw\" are distinct and should not be included in this count.\n\n4.  **Sum the Counts:** To find the total number of made shots by both teams, I sum the counts from each identified \"Made Shot\" node.\n    Total Made Shots = (Count from Column 1) + (Count from Column 2) + (Count from Column 5)\n    Total Made Shots = 2 + 8 + 20\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:**\n    Total Made Shots = 30.\n\n6.  **Confirm Interpretation:** The numbers next to the event nodes (e.g., \"Made Shot | 2\", \"Made Shot 8\", \"Made Shot 20\") represent the frequency of that event occurring within the set of sequences depicted in that column or pathway. The question asks for the \"total made shots\", implying a sum of all such occurrences. The phrase \"by both teams\" is satisfied because we are summing all \"Made Shot\" events regardless of which team's offense preceded them.\n    *   UNC Made Shots = 2 (from column 1) + 20 (from column 5) = 22\n    *   UMD Made Shots = 8 (from column 2) = 8\n    *   Total = 22 + 8 = 30.",
