  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about events immediately after \"UMD Offense\". So, we start by locating the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify the target event:** The question is specifically about \"missed shots\". We need to find a \"Missed Shot\" node that is directly connected from \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  **Trace the path and find the count:**\n    *   Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n    *   Observe the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\". There are three:\n        *   One link goes to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n        *   One link goes to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n        *   One link goes to \"_Exit\" with a count of 21.\n    *   The link connecting \"UMD Offense\" directly to \"Missed Shot\" represents the sequences where a shot was missed immediately after UMD Offense.\n    *   The numeric label on this link is 14.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, there were 14 shots missed immediately after UMD Offense.",
