I need to find a node or a sequence of nodes in the diagram that represents \"Free Throw\" and is attributed to \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  I examine all the nodes in the diagram. The nodes present are: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"Jump Ball\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Made Shot\", \"_Exit\", \"Rebound\", \"UMD Offense\", and \"Foul\".\n4.  There is no node labeled \"Free Throw\" in the diagram.\n5.  Since the event \"Free Throw\" is not represented as a node in this visualization, I cannot determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense.",
