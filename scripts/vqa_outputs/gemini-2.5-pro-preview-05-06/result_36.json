  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify \"Discharge-Alive\" events:** The goal is to find the total number of patients discharged alive. This means we need to find all occurrences of the \"Discharge-Alive\" event in the diagram and sum the number of sequences (patients) that pass through these events.\n\n2.  **Locate \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes:** There are two nodes labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram.\n    *   One is located on the right side, directly following the \"Emergency\" node.\n    *   Another is located at the bottom of the diagram, receiving flows from a \"Floor\" node and an \"ICU\" node.\n\n3.  **Analyze flows into the first \"Discharge-Alive\" node (top right):**\n    *   There is one incoming link to this node: from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n    *   The numeric label on this link is 38. This means 38 patients were discharged alive directly after Emergency.\n    *   This flow continues to an \"_Exit\" node, also with a count of 38.\n\n4.  **Analyze flows into the second \"Discharge-Alive\" node (bottom):**\n    *   There are two incoming links to this node:\n        *   From \"Floor\" (the node located above it, which itself comes after an \"ICU\" stay) to \"Discharge-Alive\". The numeric label on this link is 16. This means 16 patients followed a path that included ICU, then Floor, and then were discharged alive.\n        *   From \"ICU\" (the node located to its right, which itself comes after a \"Floor\" stay that followed an earlier \"ICU\" stay) to \"Discharge-Alive\". The numeric label on this link is 8. This means 8 patients followed a path that included an initial ICU stay, then Floor, then another ICU stay, and then were discharged alive.\n    *   The total number of patients discharged alive through this second \"Discharge-Alive\" node is the sum of these incoming flows: 16 + 8 = 24.\n    *   This is consistent with the outgoing link from this \"Discharge-Alive\" node to \"_Exit\", which has a label of 24.\n\n5.  **Calculate total patients discharged alive:** The total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of patients discharged alive through the first \"Discharge-Alive\" event and those discharged alive through the second \"Discharge-Alive\" event.\n    *   From the first \"Discharge-Alive\" node: 38 patients.\n    *   From the second \"Discharge-Alive\" node: 16 + 8 = 24 patients.\n    *   Total = 38 + 24 = 62 patients.\n\n6.  **Verification (optional but good practice):**\n    *   Sum of flows from \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes to \"_Exit\" nodes:\n        *   The top-right \"Discharge-Alive\" node sends 38 to \"_Exit\".\n        *   The bottom \"Discharge-Alive\" node sends 24 to \"_Exit\".\n        *   Total = 38 + 24 = 62.\n    This confirms the calculation. Although there might be minor inconsistencies in flow conservation at other nodes in the diagram (e.g., 100 at _Start vs. a sum of 38+36+24=98 at various _Exit points, or 62 into the first ICU node vs 60 out), the question asks specifically about \"Discharge-Alive\", and the counts on the links directly related to this event are explicit. We rely solely on these explicit values as per the instructions.\n\nThe counts of sequences on the links are:\n-   Emergency -> Discharge-Alive (top right): 38\n-   Floor -> Discharge-Alive (bottom): 16\n-   ICU -> Discharge-Alive (bottom): 8\n\nTotal = 38 + 16 + 8 = 62.",
