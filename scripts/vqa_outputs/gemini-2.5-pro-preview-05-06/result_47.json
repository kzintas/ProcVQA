  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency. This means we need to find all paths that start from the \"Emergency\" node and eventually lead to the \"Die\" node, and sum the number of sequences following these paths.\n\n2.  First, identify the \"Emergency\" node in the diagram. All patients start at \"_Start\" (100), go to \"Arrival\" (100), and then to \"Emergency\" (100).\n\n3.  From \"Emergency\", patients can follow several paths:\n    *   Emergency -> Floor (21 sequences)\n    *   Emergency -> ICU (41 sequences)\n    *   Emergency -> Discharge-Alive (38 sequences)\n\n4.  We are interested in paths leading to \"Die\". Let's trace where these initial paths go:\n    *   Sequences going Emergency -> Discharge-Alive (38) are discharged alive and then go to \"_Exit\". These patients did not die.\n    *   Sequences going Emergency -> Floor (21) then proceed to Floor -> ICU (21 sequences). So, 21 patients from Emergency reach ICU via Floor.\n    *   Sequences going Emergency -> ICU (41) reach ICU directly.\n\n5.  Now, let's look at the \"ICU\" node. It receives patients from:\n    *   Emergency (directly): 41 sequences.\n    *   Floor (which came from Emergency): 21 sequences.\n    So, the total number of sequences entering ICU that originated from Emergency is 41 + 21 = 62 sequences.\n\n6.  From the \"ICU\" node, patients can follow two paths:\n    *   ICU -> Floor (another \"Floor\" node, 24 sequences). These patients then go Floor -> Discharge-Alive (24 sequences) -> _Exit (24 sequences). These patients did not die.\n    *   ICU -> Die (36 sequences). These patients died.\n\n7.  The link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" is explicitly labeled with the number 36. This means 36 sequences (patients) transitioned from ICU to Die.\n\n8.  Since all patients who reached ICU originated from \"Emergency\" (either directly or via the first \"Floor\" node), the 36 patients who went from ICU to Die are patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency.\n\n9.  No other paths lead to the \"Die\" node. The only incoming link to \"Die\" is from \"ICU\".\n\n10. Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the number of sequences on the link ICU -> Die, which is 36.\n\n11. We note some inconsistencies in the flow counts if the diagram were perfectly balanced (e.g., 62 sequences enter ICU, but only 24+36=60 exit ICU; 36 sequences enter Die, but only 21 exit Die to _Exit). However, the instructions state to answer \"solely based on what is explicitly shown in the visualization\" and that \"Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences\". The number of sequences entering the \"Die\" state from \"ICU\" is explicitly 36.",
