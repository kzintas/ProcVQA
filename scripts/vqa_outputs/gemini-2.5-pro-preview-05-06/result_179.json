  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "49",
  "llm_answer": "49",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the \"Rebound\" nodes:** The diagram shows two distinct nodes labeled \"Rebound\".\n    *   One \"Rebound\" node appears in the sequence after \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   Another \"Rebound\" node appears in the sequence after \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2.  **Determine the number of sequences leading to the first \"Rebound\" node:**\n    *   There is a directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to the first \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   The numeric label next to this link is 15. This indicates that 15 sequences include the event \"Rebound\" immediately following \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   The outgoing link from this \"Rebound\" node to \"Missed Shot\" also has a value of 15, which is consistent. So, 15 rebounds occurred here.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of sequences leading to the second \"Rebound\" node:**\n    *   There is a directed link from \"UMD Offense\" to the second \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   The numeric label next to this link is 34. This indicates that 34 sequences include the event \"Rebound\" immediately following \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   The outgoing link from this \"Rebound\" node to \"_Exit\" has a value of 15. While this outgoing value is different from the incoming value (34), the question asks for the total number of rebounds. The number of rebounds occurring at this point is the number of sequences that entered this \"Rebound\" state, which is 34.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of rebounds:**\n    *   The total number of rebounds is the sum of rebounds from all occurrences of the \"Rebound\" event.\n    *   Total rebounds = (Rebounds after UNC Offense) + (Rebounds after UMD Offense)\n    *   Total rebounds = 15 + 34\n\n5.  **Sum the values:**\n    *   Total rebounds = 15 + 34 = 49.\n\nThe values on the links leading *into* the \"Rebound\" nodes represent the number of times those specific rebound events occurred.",
