  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the \"Rebound\" node:** The diagram shows a node labeled \"Rebound\".\n2.  **Identify outgoing links from \"Rebound\":** From the \"Rebound\" node, there are two outgoing links.\n    *   One link points to the \"Made Shot\" node.\n    *   The other link points to the \"\\_Exit\" node.\n3.  **Find the link to \"Made Shot\":** We are interested in shots made *directly after* a Rebound. This corresponds to the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n4.  **Read the count on the link:** The numeric label next to the link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 15. This indicates that 15 sequences followed this specific path.",
