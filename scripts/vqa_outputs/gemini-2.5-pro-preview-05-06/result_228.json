  "question": "How many total missed shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "39",
  "llm_answer": "39",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the total number of missed shots made by both teams. I need to locate all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the diagram.\n2.  I will examine each of the four main vertical pathways shown in the diagram:\n    *   **Pathway 1 (starting with `_Start 2`):**\n        *   There is a node \"Missed Shot\" with a value of `2` next to it. This indicates 2 sequences include this event.\n    *   **Pathway 2 (starting with `_Start 19`):**\n        *   There is a node \"Missed Shot\" with a value of `19` next to it. This indicates 19 sequences include this event.\n    *   **Pathway 3 (starting with `_Start 33`):**\n        *   There is a node \"Missed Shot\" with a value of `18` next to it. This indicates 18 sequences include this event.\n    *   **Pathway 4 (starting with `_Start 15`):**\n        *   There are no \"Missed Shot\" nodes in this pathway.\n\n3.  To find the total number of missed shots, I sum the values associated with each \"Missed Shot\" node found:\n    *   Total Missed Shots = (Value from Pathway 1) + (Value from Pathway 2) + (Value from Pathway 3)\n    *   Total Missed Shots = 2 + 19 + 18\n\n4.  Calculate the sum:\n    *   2 + 19 = 21\n    *   21 + 18 = 39\n\nTherefore, the total number of missed shots by both teams is 39.",
