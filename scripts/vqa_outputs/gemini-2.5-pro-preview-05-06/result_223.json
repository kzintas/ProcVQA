  "reasoning": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the total number of \"shots made by only the UNC offense\". This means we need to find sequences where the event \"UNC Offense\" is immediately followed by the event \"Made Shot\", and sum the counts of such sequences. We should distinguish \"Made Shot\" from \"Made Free Throw\".\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links:**\n    *   \"UNC Offense\" nodes: These are the starting points for the action.\n    *   \"Made Shot\" nodes: These are the successful outcomes we are interested in.\n    *   Directed links from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\": The numeric labels on these links will give the count of shots made by UNC Offense.\n\n3.  **Examine Each Column for \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" sequences:**\n\n    *   **Column 1:**\n        *   There is a \"_Start\" (2) -> \"UNC Offense\" (2) sequence.\n        *   From \"UNC Offense\" (node value 2), there are outgoing links to \"Jump Ball\" (1) and \"Missed Shot\" (2).\n        *   Neither of these is \"Made Shot\".\n        *   There is a \"Made Shot\" node (value 2) lower in this column, but there is no explicit directed link shown from \"UNC Offense\" (2) to this \"Made Shot\" (2) node.
