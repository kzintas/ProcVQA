  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about patients going to the \"Floor\" *after* the \"ICU\". So, the starting point in the diagram is the \"ICU\" node.\n2.  **Examine outgoing links from ICU:** From the \"ICU\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to the \"Die\" node, with a value of 36. This means 36 sequences (patients) went from ICU to Die.\n    *   One link goes to the \"_Exit\" node, with a value of 26. This means 26 sequences (patients) went from ICU to _Exit.\n3.  **Look for \"Floor\" node:** The question asks about patients going to the \"Floor\". I need to check if there is a node labeled \"Floor\" that is directly connected from the \"ICU\" node or if \"Floor\" appears anywhere else in the diagram as a possible destination.\n4.  **Analyze diagram for \"Floor\":** Upon examining the entire diagram, there is no node labeled \"Floor\". The nodes present are: _Start, Arrival, Emergency, ICU, Die, _Exit, Discharge-Alive.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since there is no \"Floor\" node depicted in the visualization, it is impossible to determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU based solely on the provided diagram.",
