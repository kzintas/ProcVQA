  "reasoning": "The user wants to find the total number of \"Missed Shot\" events by both teams based on the provided node-link diagram.

The numeric labels next to links or nodes show the count of sequences.\n\n    *   **First occurrence:** In the leftmost pathway group (originating from \"\\_Start 2\"):\n        There is a node \"Missed Shot\".
