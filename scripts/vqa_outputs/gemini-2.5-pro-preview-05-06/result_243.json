If we follow \"UMD Offense\" (10), it leads to \"Made Shot\" (3). No \"Made Free Throw\" here linked to this \"UMD Offense\". (Note: \"UMD Offense (10)\" and \"Made Shot (3)\" are parallel outcomes from \"UNC Offense\" in this column, not strictly sequential from each other in the way it's usually drawn, but the question is about actions by UMD Offense).\n        *   Column 5: \"_Start\" -> \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Missed Shot\" (9) -> \"UMD Offense\" (8) -> \"Rebound\" (8) -> \"Missed Shot\" (6).
