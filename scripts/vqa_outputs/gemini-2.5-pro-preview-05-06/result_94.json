  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of patients who were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency. This means we need to find a direct link from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n2.  Let's examine each of the four vertical pathways presented in the diagram:\n\n    *   **Pathway 1 (leftmost):**\n        *   The sequence is _Start -> Arrival (12) -> Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die_Exit (12).\n        *   In this pathway, after \"Emergency\", patients go to \"ICU\". There is no direct \"Discharge-Alive\" after \"Emergency\".\n\n    *   **Pathway 2 (second from left):**\n        *   The sequence is _Start -> Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive_Exit (37).\n        *   In this pathway, after \"Emergency\", patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\". The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of 37.\n\n    *   **Pathway 3 (third from left):**\n        *   The sequence starts with _Start -> Arrival (24) -> Emergency (24).\n        *   After \"Emergency\", patients go to \"ICU\" (count 23).\n        *   From \"ICU\", patients go to \"Floor\" (count 23).\n        *   From \"Floor\", patients go to \"Discharge-Alive\" (count 20).\n        *   In this pathway, \"Discharge-Alive\" occurs after \"Emergency\", but not *directly* after. There are \"ICU\" and \"Floor\" in between. So, this pathway does not contribute to the count of patients discharged alive *directly* after Emergency.\n\n    *   **Pathway 4 (rightmost):**\n        *   The sequence is _Start -> Arrival (27) -> Emergency (27) -> Floor (27).\n        *   After \"Emergency\", patients go to \"Floor\". There is no direct \"Discharge-Alive\" after \"Emergency\".\n\n3.  Based on the analysis, only Pathway 2 shows a direct transition from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". The number of sequences (patients) following this specific path (Emergency -> Discharge-Alive) is explicitly labeled as 37 next to the link connecting these two nodes in the second pathway.\n\n4.  Therefore, the total number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency is 37.",
