  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n2.  I need to examine the pathways originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node to see if there is any event related to \"Free Throw Made\".\n3.  The \"UMD Offense\" node has three outgoing paths:\n    *   One path goes to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences.\n    *   One path goes to \"Missed Shot\" with 14 sequences.\n    *   One path goes to \"_Exit\" with 21 sequences.\n4.  From \"Rebound\", there are two paths:\n    *   One path goes to \"Made Shot\" with 15 sequences.\n    *   One path goes to \"_Exit\" with 19 sequences.\n5.  From \"Missed Shot\", there is one path to \"_Exit\" with 14 sequences.\n6.  The diagram shows events like \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\". However, there is no specific node or label indicating \"Free Throw Made\". A \"Made Shot\" could be a field goal or a free throw, but the diagram does not provide this level of detail.\n7.  Since the visualization does not explicitly show \"Free Throw Made\" events, it is impossible to determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.",
