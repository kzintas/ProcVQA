  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify \"Rebound\" nodes:** I will scan the entire diagram to locate all nodes labeled \"Rebound\".\n2.  **Extract counts for each \"Rebound\" node:** For each \"Rebound\" node, I will look at the numeric label next to it or the incoming link leading to it, which indicates the number of sequences passing through that event.\n    *   In the second main column from the left, there is a \"Rebound\" node. The link from \"UNC Offense\" to this \"Rebound\" node has a value of 14. This means there were 14 rebounds in this sequence.\n    *   In the first main column from the left, there is a \"Rebound\" node. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to this \"Rebound\" node has a value of 7. This means there were 7 rebounds in this sequence.\n    *   In the third main column from the left, there is a \"Rebound\" node. The link from \"UNC Offense\" to this \"Rebound\" node has a value of 1. This means there was 1 rebound in this sequence.\n    *   In the second main column from the left (further down), there is another \"Rebound\" node. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to this \"Rebound\" node has a value of 11. This means there were 11 rebounds in this sequence.\n3.  **Sum the counts:** I will add up all the counts identified in the previous step to get the total number of rebounds.\n    Total Rebounds = 14 (from UNC Offense) + 7 (from UMD Offense) + 1 (from UNC Offense) + 11 (from UMD Offense)\n    Total Rebounds = 21 + 1 + 11\n    Total Rebounds = 22 + 11\n    Total Rebounds = 33",
