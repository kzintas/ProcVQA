  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the \"UMD Offense\" node:** This node is located in the middle of the diagram.\n2.  **Examine outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":**\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a numeric label of 34. This means 34 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n    *   There is another link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" with a numeric label of 35. This means 35 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" directly to \"_Exit\".\n3.  **Determine transitions *not* to \"Rebound\":** The question asks how many times \"UMD Offense\" did *not* transition to \"Rebound\". The only other transition shown from \"UMD Offense\" is to \"_Exit\".\n4.  **Count the non-Rebound transitions:** The number of sequences where \"UMD Offense\" transitioned to \"_Exit\" (and therefore not to \"Rebound\") is 35.",
