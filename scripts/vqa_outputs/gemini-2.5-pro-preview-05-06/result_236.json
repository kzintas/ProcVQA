  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "3",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of free throws made by \"UMD Offense\". This means we need to find \"Made Free Throw\" events that can be attributed to UMD when they are on offense.\n\n2.  I will scan the diagram for all nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\".\n    *   In the middle column, there is a \"Made Free Throw\" node with 11 sequences passing through it.\n    *   Also in the middle column, further down, there is another \"Made Free Throw\" node with 3 sequences passing through it.\n    *   There are no other \"Made Free Throw\" nodes in the diagram.\n\n3.  Now, I will analyze the context of these \"Made Free Throw\" events to determine if they were made \"by UMD Offense\".\n\n4.  Consider the \"Made Free Throw\" event with 3 sequences:\n    *   Looking at the middle column, this \"Made Free Throw\" node is directly preceded by a \"UMD Offense\" node. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to this \"Made Free Throw\" node has a label \"3\".\n    *   The sequence is: `... -> UMD Offense (10) -3-> Made Free Throw (3) -> ...`\n    *   This explicitly shows that 3 sequences involved UMD being on offense, and then making a free throw. Therefore, these 3 free throws were made by UMD Offense.\n\n5.  Consider the \"Made Free Throw\" event with 11 sequences:\n    *   Looking at the middle column, this \"Made Free Throw\" node is preceded by a \"Foul\" node (12 sequences).\n    *   The \"Foul\" node is preceded by a \"UNC Offense\" node (12 sequences).\n    *   The sequence is: `... -> UNC Offense (12) -> Foul (12) -> Made Free Throw (11) -> UMD Offense (10) -> ...`\n    *   The diagram states that a \"Foul\" occurred while \"UNC Offense\" was active. Then, 11 \"Made Free Throw\" events occurred, followed by \"UMD Offense\" in 10 of those sequences.\n    *   The diagram does not explicitly state which team committed the foul or which team shot and made these 11 free throws.\n        *   Possibility 1: UMD committed a foul while UNC was on offense. UNC shot and made 11 free throws. Then UMD gained possession (UMD Offense). This is a common basketball scenario. In this case, the free throws were made by UNC, not UMD.\n        *   Possibility 2: UNC committed a foul (e.g., an offensive foul resulting in free throws for the opponent, or a technical/flagrant foul) while on offense. UMD shot and made 11 free throws. Then UMD gained possession (UMD Offense). This is also possible.\n    *   Since the visualization does not explicitly state that these 11 free throws were made *by UMD*, and we must answer *solely* based on what is explicitly shown, we cannot definitively attribute these 11 free throws to UMD Offense. The event is \"Made Free Throw\", not \"Made Free Throw by UMD\".\n\n6.  Based on the analysis, only the 3 free throws that directly follow the \"UMD Offense\" node can be unambiguously attributed to \"UMD Offense\" making them.\n\n7.  Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, based solely on explicit information in the diagram, is 3.",
