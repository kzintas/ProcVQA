  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "49",
  "llm_answer": "49",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify \"Rebound\" Nodes:** The diagram shows two nodes explicitly labeled \"Rebound\".\n    *   The first \"Rebound\" node appears after \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   The second \"Rebound\" node appears after \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the first \"Rebound\" node:**\n    *   There is a link from \"UNC Offense\" to this \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   The numeric label next to this link is 15.\n    *   This means there were 15 sequences where \"UNC Offense\" was followed by a \"Rebound\". So, 15 rebounds occurred at this point.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second \"Rebound\" node:**\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to this \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   The numeric label next to this link is 34.\n    *   This means there were 34 sequences where \"UMD Offense\" was followed by a \"Rebound\". So, 34 rebounds occurred at this point.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Rebounds:** To find the total number of rebounds in the match, we sum the number of rebound events indicated by these two \"Rebound\" nodes.\n    *   Rebounds after UNC Offense = 15\n    *   Rebounds after UMD Offense = 34\n    *   Total Rebounds = 15 + 34 = 49.\n\nThe diagram does not show any other nodes or paths that would indicate additional rebound events. Therefore, the total number of rebounds is the sum of the values on the links leading into the \"Rebound\" nodes.",
