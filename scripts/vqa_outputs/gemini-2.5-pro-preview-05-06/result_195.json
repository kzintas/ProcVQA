  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant starting node:** The question asks about events occurring after \"UMD Offense\". I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Examine outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":** I look at the directed links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node to see what events follow it and with what frequency.\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a label indicating 34 sequences.\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" with a label indicating 22 sequences.\n\n3.  **Look for the \"Steal\" event:** The question asks specifically for \"steals\". I scan all node labels in the entire diagram to see if an event type \"Steal\" is represented.\n    *   The nodes shown are: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\".\n    *   There is no node labeled \"Steal\" anywhere in the diagram.\n\n4.  **Determine the count:** Since \"Steal\" is not an event type shown in the diagram, it cannot appear as a successor to \"UMD Offense\" (or any other node). The events that are explicitly shown to follow \"UMD Offense\" are \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\". Neither of these is \"Steal\".\n    Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the visualization, the number of times \"Steal\" occurred after \"UMD Offense\" is 0. The visualization provides a complete account of the direct successors of \"UMD Offense\" within the scope of the events it tracks, and \"Steal\" is not among them, nor is \"Steal\" a tracked event type in this diagram.",
