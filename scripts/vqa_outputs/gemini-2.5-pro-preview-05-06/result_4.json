From the \"ICU\" node, I need to find an outgoing link that goes to a node labeled \"Floor\".\n4.  The diagram shows a node \"ICU\".\n5.  From \"ICU\", there are three outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to \"Die\" with a value of 36.\n    *   One link goes to \"Floor\" with a value of 24.\n    *   One link goes to \"_Exit\" with a value of 2.\n6.  The link from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" has a numeric label of 24.\n7.  This means 24 sequences (patients) followed the path from ICU to Floor.",
