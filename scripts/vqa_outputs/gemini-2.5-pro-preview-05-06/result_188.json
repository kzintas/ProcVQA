Next, I examine the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node to identify the subsequent events.\n    - There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n    - There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" with a count of 22.\n4.  I then check if any of these subsequent nodes (\"Rebound\", \"_Exit\") are labeled \"Steal\". Neither of them is.\n5.  I also scan the entire diagram to see if \"Steal\" is a type of event (node label) represented anywhere. The nodes shown are: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"UMD Offense\", and \"_Exit\". The label \"Steal\" does not appear on any node in the diagram.\n6.  Since \"Steal\" is not an event type explicitly shown or defined in this visualization (i.e., there is no node labeled \"Steal\"), the diagram does not provide information about the occurrence of steals.\n7.  According to the instructions, if the answer cannot be determined from the visualization, I should respond with 'indeterminate'. Because the visualization does not contain any information about an event called \"Steal\", I cannot determine how many occurred after \"UMD Offense\".",
