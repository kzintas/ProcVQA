  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the total number of patients who were discharged alive. This requires identifying all nodes in the diagram that represent a \"Discharge-Alive\" event and summing the number of sequences associated with them.\n\n2.  **Examine the Diagram for \"Discharge-Alive\" Nodes:**\n    *   The diagram is organized into four main vertical pathways.\n    *   **Pathway 1 (leftmost):** This pathway ends with \"Die _Exit (12)\". No \"Discharge-Alive\" here.\n    *   **Pathway 2 (second from left):** This pathway shows `_Start (37) -> Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive _Exit (37)`. The node \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\" has a numeric label \"37\" next to it. This indicates that 37 patients followed this path and were discharged alive.\n    *   **Pathway 3 (third from left):** This pathway shows `_Start (24) -> Arrival (24) -> Emergency (24) -> ICU (23) -> Floor (23) -> Discharge-Alive (20) -> _Exit (24)`. The node \"Discharge-Alive\" has a numeric label \"20\" next to it. This indicates that 20 patients reached the \"Discharge-Alive\" state through this pathway.\n    *   **Pathway 4 (rightmost):** This pathway includes `Floor (27) -> ICU (24) -> Die (18) -> _Exit (27)`. No \"Discharge-Alive\" here, but a \"Die\" event.\n\n3.  **Identify Counts for \"Discharge-Alive\" Events:**\n    *   From Pathway 2, the node \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\" has a count of 37.\n    *   From Pathway 3, the node \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of 20.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** To find the total number of patients discharged alive, sum the counts from all identified \"Discharge-Alive\" events.\n    *   Total = (Count from Pathway 2's \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\") + (Count from Pathway 3's \"Discharge-Alive\")\n    *   Total = 37 + 20\n\n5.  **Final Summation:**\n    *   Total = 57\n\nThe numbers next to the nodes represent the count of sequences passing through or ending at that node for the specific pathway shown. The four pathways appear to represent distinct sets of sequences or cohorts given their separate `_Start` nodes with different initial counts (12, 37, 24, 27).",
