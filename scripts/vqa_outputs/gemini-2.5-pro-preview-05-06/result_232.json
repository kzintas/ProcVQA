  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "19",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of missed shots that occur *after* a \"UNC Offense\" event and *before* a \"UMD Offense\" event. This means we are looking for sequences of the form: `UNC Offense -> ... -> Missed Shot -> ... -> UMD Offense`. The number of such \"Missed Shot\" events will be the sum of sequences passing through such a pattern. The numeric labels next to the links show the exact count of sequences following that specific path segment.\n\nLet's examine each column (pathway) in the diagram where \"UNC Offense\" appears:\n\n1.  **Column 1 (starts with _Start 2):**\n    *   The sequence shown is: `_Start -(2)-> UNC Offense -(2)-> Missed Shot -(2)-> Made Shot -(2)-> _Exit`.\n    *   Here, \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   However, this \"Missed Shot\" is followed by \"Made Shot\", not \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   Thus, this pathway contributes 0 to the count.\n\n2.  **Column 2 (starts with _Start 19):**\n    *   The sequence shown involving a \"Missed Shot\" is: `_Start -(19)-> UNC Offense -(19)-> Rebound -(19)-> Missed Shot`.\n    *   From this \"Missed Shot\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n        *   `Missed Shot -(17)-> UMD Offense`. This path segment is `UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense`. Here, \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\" (via \"Rebound\") and before \"UMD Offense\". The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a count of 17. This means 17 sequences follow this pattern. These 17 missed shots satisfy the condition.\n        *   `Missed Shot -(15)-> Rebound` (a subsequent, lower Rebound node). This path does not lead to \"UMD Offense\" immediately after the \"Missed Shot\".\n    *   Thus, this pathway contributes 17 to the count.\n\n3.  **Column 3 (starts with _Start 12):**\n    *   The sequence is: `_Start -(12)-> UNC Offense -(12)-> Foul`.\n    *   No \"Missed Shot\" event occurs after \"UNC Offense\" in this pathway.\n    *   Thus, this pathway contributes 0 to the count.\n\n4.  **Column 4 (starts with _Start 8):**\n    *   The sequences from \"UNC Offense\" are:\n        *   `UNC Offense -(5)-> Turnover`. No \"Missed Shot\".\n        *   `UNC Offense -(7)-> UMD Offense`. There is no \"Missed Shot\" *between* \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" in this path.\n    *   Thus, this pathway contributes 0 to the count.\n\n5.  **Column 5 (starts with _Start 28):**\n    *   From \"UNC Offense\", there are three outgoing links:\n        *   `UNC Offense -(20)-> Made Shot`. No \"Missed Shot\".\n        *   `UNC Offense -(25)-> UMD Offense`. No \"Missed Shot\" *between* \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n        *   `UNC Offense -(19)-> Missed Shot`. Here, a \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\". We need to check if this \"Missed Shot\" is followed by \"UMD Offense\". Looking at the diagram, this \"Missed Shot\" node (red, with label 19 next to it, in the last column) does not have any explicit outgoing link to a \"UMD Offense\" node or any other event node. It appears to be the last event in that branch before the implicit `_Exit`.\n    *   Since this \"Missed Shot\" is not followed by a \"UMD Offense\" in its sequence, this pathway contributes 0 to the count.\n\nSumming the contributions from all pathways: 0 (Column 1) + 17 (Column 2) + 0 (Column 3) + 0 (Column 4) + 0 (Column 5) = 17.\n\nThe total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is 17.
