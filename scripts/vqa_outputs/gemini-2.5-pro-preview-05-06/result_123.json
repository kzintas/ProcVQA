  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",

  "reasoning": "1.  The node \"UMD Offense\" is the starting point for this question.\n2.  We need to find all pathways originating from \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  The diagram shows the following pathways and their counts from \"UMD Offense\":\n    *   UMD Offense -> Rebound: 34\n    *   UMD Offense -> Missed Shot: 14\n    *   UMD Offense -> Foul: 10\n    *   UMD Offense -> Made Shot: 8\n    *   UMD Offense -> _Exit: 3\n4.  The total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" is the sum of these counts: 34 + 14 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 69. This also matches the incoming link to \"UMD Offense\" from \"UNC Offense\".\n5.  The question asks how many times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound.\n6.  This means we need to sum all transitions from \"UMD Offense\" that go to nodes other than \"Rebound\".\n7.  These transitions are:\n    *   UMD Offense -> Missed Shot: 14\n    *   UMD Offense -> Foul: 10\n    *   UMD Offense -> Made Shot: 8\n    *   UMD Offense -> _Exit: 3\n8.  The sum of these transitions is 14 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 35.\n9.  Alternatively, we can subtract the number of transitions to \"Rebound\" (34) from the total number of transitions from \"UMD Offense\" (69): 69 - 34 = 35.",
