  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" occurred after \"UNC Offense\".\n2.  I need to locate all instances of the \"UNC Offense\" node in the diagram.\n3.  Then, for each \"UNC Offense\" node, I need to examine the outgoing links to see if any lead to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n4.  The count on the link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" will give the number of times this specific sequence occurred.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n-   **Column 1:**\n    -   There is a node \"_Start\" (count 2) leading to \"UNC Offense\" (count 2).\n    -   From this \"UNC Offense\" node, there is a link to \"Jump Ball\". The numeric label next to this link is \"1\". This means \"Jump Ball\" occurred 1 time after this specific \"UNC Offense\" event.\n    -   There is another link from this \"UNC Offense\" node to \"Missed Shot\" (count 2), but this is not relevant to the question. (Correction: The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" has a count of 1. The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" also originates from this \"UNC Offense\" node, but it's a different path. The node \"UNC Offense\" has an incoming count of 2. It then branches to \"Jump Ball\" (1) and \"Missed Shot\" (implicitly 2-1=1 if no other paths, but the diagram shows a count of 2 next to \"Missed Shot\". This indicates an inconsistency or misinterpretation of how node counts and link counts relate. Let's re-evaluate based on the provided instructions: \"Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path\" and \"Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences\". So we should rely on the link labels.)\n    -   Let's re-examine Column 1:\n        - \"_Start\" (2) -> \"UNC Offense\" (2)\n        - \"UNC Offense\" (2) -> \"Jump Ball\" (link count 1)\n        - \"UNC Offense\" (2) -> \"Missed Shot\" (link count 2). This means the sum of outgoing links (1+2=3) from \"UNC Offense\" exceeds its incoming flow (2). This is unusual or there's something subtle. However, the instruction is to *answer solely based on what is explicitly shown*. The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" explicitly shows a count of \"1\".\n\n-   **Column 2:**\n    -   \"_Start\" (14) -> \"UNC Offense\" (14)\n    -   From this \"UNC Offense\" node, links go to:\n        -   \"Rebound\" (count 14 on the Rebound node, not the link itself from UNC Offense. The link to Rebound from UNC Offense is not explicitly labelled but is implied by the flow. Let's assume the node count means total sequences passing through it. The links originating from \"UNC Offense\" are the important part).\n        -   The diagram in Column 2 shows \"UNC Offense\" leading to \"Rebound\" and \"Missed Shot\". There is no link to \"Jump Ball\".\n\n-   **Column 3:**\n    -   \"_Start\" (12) -> \"UNC Offense\" (12)\n    -   From this \"UNC Offense\" node, links go to:\n        -   \"Rebound\" (count 5)\n        -   \"Foul\" (count 9)\n    -   No link to \"Jump Ball\".\n\n-   **Column 4:**\n    -   \"_Start\" (14) -> \"UNC Offense\" (14)\n    -   From this \"UNC Offense\" node, links go to:\n        -   \"Steal\" (count 6)\n        -   \"UMD Offense\" (count 10)\n        -   \"Made Shot\" (count 3)\n    -   No link to \"Jump Ball\".\n\n-   **Column 5:**\n    -   \"_Start\" (9) -> \"UNC Offense\" (9)\n    -   From this \"UNC Offense\" node, a link goes to:\n        -   \"Missed Shot\" (count 9)\n    -   No link to \"Jump Ball\".\n\n-   **Column 6:**\n    -   \"_Start\" (18) -> \"UNC Offense\" (18)\n    -   From this \"UNC Offense\" node, a link goes to:\n        -   \"Made Shot\" (count 17)\n    -   No link to \"Jump Ball\".\n\nThe only instance where \"UNC Offense\" is directly followed by \"Jump Ball\" is in the first depicted sequence (leftmost column). The link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" has a numeric label \"1\".\n\nTherefore, a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense 1 time. The interpretation of node counts versus link counts is critical. The instruction \"Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences\" is key.\nIn the first column:\n_Start (2)\n -> UNC Offense (2)\n    -> Jump Ball (link label: 1)\n    -> Missed Shot (node label: 2, no direct link label from UNC Offense to Missed Shot is clearly visible, but \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 2 and appears after \"UNC Offense\". The OCR indicates \"Missed Shot 2\", which refers to the node count, not a link count from UNC Offense. However, the image shows a link from UNC Offense to Missed Shot, and then Missed Shot has a count of 2. Let's assume the links are what matter.)\n\nLet's focus on the explicit link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\".\nIn the very first column:\n- \"_Start\" (node count 2)\n- \"UNC Offense\" (node count 2)\n- From \"UNC Offense\", a link goes to \"Jump Ball\". The label next to this *link* is \"1\".\n- From \"UNC Offense\", a link also goes to \"Missed Shot\". The node \"Missed Shot\" has a count of \"2\". There is no separate label on this specific link segment.\n\nThe question asks \"How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?\". This refers to the sequence \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Jump Ball\".\nThe diagram shows one such path in the first column. The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" is explicitly labeled with the number \"1\". This means this specific sequence occurred 1 time.\n\nWe need to confirm there are no other \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Jump Ball\" paths.\n- Column 1: UNC Offense -> Jump Ball (1)\n- Column 2: UNC Offense -> Rebound, UNC Offense -> Missed Shot. No Jump Ball.\n- Column 3: UNC Offense -> Rebound (5), UNC Offense -> Foul (9). No Jump Ball.\n- Column 4: UNC Offense -> Steal (6), UNC Offense -> UMD Offense (10), UNC Offense -> Made Shot (3). No Jump Ball.\n- Column 5: UNC Offense -> Missed Shot (9). No Jump Ball.\n- Column 6: UNC Offense -> Made Shot (17). No Jump Ball.\n\nThe only path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" is in the first column, and the link has a count of 1.\nThe node \"Jump Ball\" itself has a label \"1\" next to it. This usually represents the count of sequences passing through that node. The link leading to it from \"UNC Offense\" is also labeled \"1\". This is consistent.\nThe node \"UNC Offense\" in the first column has a label \"2\". It has an outgoing link to \"Jump Ball\" (1) and an outgoing link to \"Missed Shot\". The node \"Missed Shot\" in that column has a label \"2\". If the link to Missed Shot was 1, then 1+1=2, which matches the UNC Offense count. However, the label next to the Missed Shot *node* is 2.\nThe instructions state: \"Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences\".\nIn the first column, the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" has a clear numeric label \"1\".\nLet's assume the node counts are the total flow through the node, and link counts are specific path flows.\nThe path \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Jump Ball\" has an explicit link count of 1.\n\nFinal check: The question is about the sequence \"UNC Offense\" then \"Jump Ball\".\nThe first column shows:\n_Start\n  | 2\nUNC Offense\n  | \\ 1\n  |  Jump Ball\n  |   ...\n  \\ (implied link, but let's look at explicit link counts if available)\n   Missed Shot\n\nThe link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" is labeled with \"1\".\nThere are no other instances of \"Jump Ball\" nodes in the diagram, let alone ones following \"UNC Offense\".\nSo, the answer relies solely on this one explicit link.\nThe label \"1\" next to the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" is the direct answer.\nThe node \"Jump Ball\" also has a count of \"1\", which is consistent with the incoming link.\nThe node \"UNC Offense\" in the first column has a count \"2\". It has one outgoing link to \"Jump Ball\" with count \"1\". It has another outgoing link to \"Missed Shot\". If the link to \"Missed Shot\" was also \"1\", then 1+1=2, which would make sense for the flow from \"UNC Offense\". The \"Missed Shot\" node itself has a label \"2\". This suggests that the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" might also be 1, and then \"Missed Shot\" leads to \"Made Shot / _Exit\" which also has a count of 2.\nHowever, the question is specific: \"How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?\". This means we look for \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Jump Ball\" and sum the counts on such links.\nThere is only one such link, and its count is 1.\nThe question is straightforward if we trust the link labels as per instructions.\nThe relevant elements are:\n1. The node \"UNC Offense\" in the first column.\n2. The node \"Jump Ball\" in the first column.\n3. The directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\".\n4. The numeric label \"1\" next to this link.\n\nNo other \"UNC Offense\" node is followed by a \"Jump Ball\" node.\nThus, the count is 1.",
