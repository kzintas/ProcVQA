  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The user is asking for the total number of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur after a \"UNC Offense\" event but before a \"UMD Offense\" event. I need to examine each column in the node-link diagram.\n\n**Column 1 (starts with _Start 2):**\n1.  The sequence starts with `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2).\n2.  From `UNC Offense` (2), one path goes to `Jump Ball` (1) and another path goes to `Missed Shot` (2).\n3.  Consider the path `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Missed Shot` (2). This \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\".\n4.  Following this `Missed Shot` (2), the sequence goes to `Made Shot` (2) and then `_Exit` (2).\n5.  This path does *not* contain a \"UMD Offense\" event after the \"Missed Shot\". Therefore, the \"Missed Shot\" events in this column do not satisfy the condition of being \"before UMD Offense\" in a path leading to UMD Offense.\n6.  Contribution from Column 1: 0.\n\n**Column 2 (starts with _Start 19):**\n1.  The sequence starts with `_Start` (19) -> `UNC Offense` (19).\n2.  From `UNC Offense` (19), the path goes to `Rebound` (19).\n3.  From `Rebound` (19), the path goes to `Missed Shot` (19). This \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\".\n4.  From this `Missed Shot` (node associated with 19 sequences passing through it), there is a link to `UMD Offense`. The numeric label next to this link (leading into `UMD Offense` from `Missed Shot`) is 17. This means 17 sequences follow the path segment `Missed Shot -> UMD Offense`.\n5.  So, there are 17 sequences that follow the path `UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense`.\n6.  In these 17 sequences, the \"Missed Shot\" event occurs after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\". Each such sequence contains one such \"Missed Shot\" event.\n7.  Contribution from Column 2: 17.\n\n**Column 3 (starts with _Start 33):**\n1.  The sequence starts with `_Start` (33) -> `UNC Offense` (33).\n2.  Events shown chronologically below `UNC Offense` (33) are:\n    *   `Made Shot` (28)\n    *   `UMD Offense` (26)\n    *   `Missed Shot` (18)\n3.  We are looking for a \"Missed Shot\" that is *after* `UNC Offense` and *before* `UMD Offense`.\n4.  The only \"Missed Shot\" node shown in this column is `Missed Shot` (18). Chronologically (vertically), this `Missed Shot` (18) appears *after* `UMD Offense` (26).\n5.  Therefore, there are no \"Missed Shot\" events in this column that occur *before* `UMD Offense` (and after `UNC Offense`).\n6.  Contribution from Column 3: 0.\n\n**Column 4 (starts with _Start 15):**\n1.  The sequence starts with `_Start` (15) -> `UNC Offense` (15).\n2.  From `UNC Offense` (15), the path goes to `Foul` (15).\n3.  From `Foul` (15), the path goes to `UMD Offense` (11 sequences take this link).\n4.  The sequence is `UNC Offense -> Foul -> UMD Offense`.\n5.  This path does not contain any \"Missed Shot\" event between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n6.  Contribution from Column 4: 0.\n\n**Total Calculation:**\nSumming the contributions from all columns:\nTotal missed shots = (Contribution from Column 1) + (Contribution from Column 2) + (Contribution from Column 3) + (Contribution from Column 4)\nTotal missed shots = 0 + 17 + 0 + 0 = 17.",
