  "question": "How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of shots missed immediately after the \"UMD Offense\" event.\n2.  In basketball or similar sports, a \"Rebound\" event usually occurs after a missed shot. Therefore, sequences going from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" can be interpreted as missed shots followed by a rebound.\n3.  Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n4.  Observe the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\". There are two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node. The numeric label next to this link is 34. This indicates that 34 sequences proceed from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n    *   Another link goes to the \"_Exit\" node. The numeric label next to this link is 35. This indicates that 35 sequences proceed from \"UMD Offense\" directly to \"_Exit\".\n5.  Since \"Rebound\" is the event that signifies a missed shot was taken and an attempt was made to recover the ball, the number of sequences leading from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" represents the number of missed shots (that were then rebounded) immediately after \"UMD Offense\".\n6.  Therefore, the number of shots missed immediately after \"UMD Offense\" that resulted in a rebound is 34. The question asks \"How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?\". The path to \"Rebound\" is the indicator of a missed shot.",
