  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" event occurred immediately after a \"UNC Offense\" event. This means we need to find all instances of the sequence `UNC Offense` -> `Jump Ball` and sum the counts associated with the links representing this sequence.\n\n2.  **Scan for \"UNC Offense\" Nodes:**\n    *   **Column 1:** There is a `UNC Offense` node. The label next to this node is \"2\", indicating 2 sequences pass through it or originate here in this branch.\n    *   **Column 2:** There is a `UNC Offense` node. The label next to this node is \"13\".\n    *   **Column 3:** There is a `UNC Offense` node. The label next to this node is \"26\".\n    *   **Column 4:** There is a `UNC Offense` node. The label next to this node is \"21\".\n    *   **Column 5:** There is a `UNC Offense` node. The label next to this node is \"7\".\n\n3.  **Examine Outgoing Links from Each \"UNC Offense\" Node for \"Jump Ball\":**\n\n    *   **Column 1 (UNC Offense with 2 sequences):**\n        *   There is a link from `UNC Offense` to a node labelled `Jump Ball | 1`.\n        *   Crucially, according to the instructions, \"Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences\".\n        *   Looking at the diagram (and crop_1_0.png), the number \"1\" is positioned directly to the right of the link connecting `UNC Offense` to `Jump Ball`.\n        *   Therefore, the sequence `UNC Offense` -> `Jump Ball` occurred 1 time in this pathway.\n        *   (This `UNC Offense` node also has a link to `Missed Shot`. The `UNC Offense` node has a count of 2. Since 1 sequence goes to `Jump Ball`, 2 - 1 = 1 sequence must go to `Missed Shot` via the other link. The `Missed Shot` node itself is labelled \"2\", implying it receives sequences from other paths or this is an aggregate count, but this detail is not needed for the specific question about `Jump Ball`.)\n\n    *   **Column 2 (UNC Offense with 13 sequences):**\n        *   This `UNC Offense` node has an outgoing link to `Foul` with a count of \"13\".\n        *   There is no link to a `Jump Ball` node from this `UNC Offense`.\n\n    *   **Column 3 (UNC Offense with 26 sequences):**\n        *   This `UNC Offense` node has an outgoing link to `Rebound` with a count of \"26\".\n        *   There is no link to a `Jump Ball` node from this `UNC Offense`.\n\n    *   **Column 4 (UNC Offense with 21 sequences):**\n        *   This `UNC Offense` node has an outgoing link to `Made Shot` with a count of \"20\".\n        *   There is no link to a `Jump Ball` node from this `UNC Offense`.\n\n    *   **Column 5 (UNC Offense with 7 sequences):**\n        *   This `UNC Offense` node has an outgoing link to `Turnover` with a count of \"4\".\n        *   It also has an outgoing link to `UMD Offense`.\n        *   There is no link to a `Jump Ball` node from this `UNC Offense`.\n\n4.  **Sum the Counts:**\n    *   The only instance where `UNC Offense` is followed by `Jump Ball` is in the first column.\n    *   The count for this sequence, taken from the label next to the link, is 1.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based solely on the visualization and the rule that numeric labels next to links show the exact count, the sequence `UNC Offense` -> `Jump Ball` occurred 1 time.",
