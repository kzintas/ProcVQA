  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks about patients who died *after* arriving at \"Emergency\". So, \"Emergency\" is our starting point in the sequence.\n2.  **Trace pathways from \"Emergency\":**\n    *   From \"Emergency\", there are two outgoing links:\n        *   One link goes to \"ICU\" with a value of 62. This means 62 sequences went from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\".\n        *   Another link goes to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a value of 38. This means 38 sequences went from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  **Follow paths that lead to \"Die\":**\n    *   Consider the path through \"ICU\":\n        *   From \"ICU\", there are three outgoing links:\n            *   One link goes to \"Die\" with a value of 36. This means 36 sequences went from \"ICU\" to \"Die\".\n            *   One link goes to \"Floor\" with a value of 24.\n            *   One link goes to \"\\_Exit\" with a value of 2.\n    *   The path \"Emergency\" -> \"ICU\" -> \"Die\" represents patients who arrived at Emergency, went to ICU, and then died. The number of patients following this specific sequence is 36, as indicated by the link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\".\n    *   Consider the path through \"Discharge-Alive\": This path does not lead to \"Die\".\n4.  **Conclusion:** The only pathway from \"Emergency\" that leads to \"Die\" is \"Emergency\" -> \"ICU\" -> \"Die\". The number of sequences following the \"ICU\" -> \"Die\" link is 36. This represents the number of patients who died after being in the ICU, and these patients had previously come from Emergency.\n\nTherefore, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
