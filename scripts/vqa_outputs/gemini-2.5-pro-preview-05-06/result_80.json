  "question": "How many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency? ",
  "true_answer": "37",
  "llm_answer": "37",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about patients *after* arriving at \"Emergency\". So, \"Emergency\" is our starting point for this specific query.\n2.  **Identify the target node:** The question asks for patients who got \"discharged alive\". We need to look for a node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  **Look for a direct link:** The question specifies \"directly after\". This means we are looking for a direct link from an \"Emergency\" node to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  **Examine each pathway:**\n    *   **Pathway 1 (leftmost):**\n        *   _Start -> Arrival (12)\n        *   Arrival -> Emergency (12)\n        *   Emergency -> ICU (12). This path does not go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n    *   **Pathway 2 (second from left):**\n        *   _Start -> Arrival (37)\n        *   Arrival -> Emergency (37)\n        *   Emergency -> Discharge-Alive (_Exit) (37). This pathway shows a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive (_Exit)\". The number of sequences on this link is 37.\n    *   **Pathway 3 (third from left):**\n        *   _Start -> Arrival (24)\n        *   Arrival -> Emergency (24)\n        *   Emergency -> ICU (23). This path does not go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Emergency\". It goes to \"ICU\", then \"Floor\", and *then* \"Discharge-Alive\".\n    *   **Pathway 4 (rightmost):**\n        *   _Start -> Arrival (27)\n        *   Arrival -> Emergency (27)\n        *   Emergency -> Floor (27). This path does not go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Emergency\".\n\n5.  **Sum the relevant counts:** Only Pathway 2 shows a direct transition from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive (_Exit)\". The count associated with this specific link is 37.\n6.  Therefore, 37 patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
