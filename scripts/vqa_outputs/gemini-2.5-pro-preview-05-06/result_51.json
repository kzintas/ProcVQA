So, the starting point for this specific query is the \"ICU\" node.\n2.  **Locate the ICU node:** The diagram shows a node labeled \"ICU\".\n3.  **Identify outgoing links from ICU:** From the \"ICU\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to a \"Floor\" node.\n    *   Another link goes to a \"Die\" node.\n4.  **Find the specific path:** We are interested in the path from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\".\n5.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label on the link connecting \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" is \"24\". This number represents the count of sequences (patients) that followed this specific path.",
