  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question specifies the sequence starts *after* \"UNC Offense\".\n2.  **Identify the event of interest:** The question asks for \"made shots\". So, we look for the \"Made Shot\" node.\n3.  **Identify the ending condition:** The sequence must be *before* \"UMD Offense\".\n4.  **Trace the path:**\n    *   Locate the \"UNC Offense\" node.\n    *   From \"UNC Offense\", there is a direct link to \"Made Shot\". The label on this link is 22. This means there are 22 sequences where \"Made Shot\" directly follows \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   From \"Made Shot\", there is a direct link to \"UMD Offense\". The label on this link is 22. This means all 22 of those sequences that went from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" then proceed to \"UMD Offense\".\n5.  **Determine the count:** The number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" and lead to \"UMD Offense\" is the value on the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\", which is then confirmed by the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n    The question is essentially asking for the number of sequences that follow the path: UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense.\n    The number of sequences going from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" is 22.\n    The number of sequences going from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is also 22.\n    This means that all 22 instances of \"Made Shot\" that followed \"UNC Offense\" also preceded \"UMD Offense\".\n    Therefore, the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD offense is 22.",
