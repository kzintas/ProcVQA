  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of patients who were discharged alive *after* going to the \"Floor\".\n2.  First, locate the \"Floor\" node in the diagram.\n3.  From the \"Floor\" node, there is one outgoing link that leads to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4.  The numeric label on the link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 24.\n5.  This means 24 sequences (patients) went from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n6.  Following this path, from \"Discharge-Alive\" (after \"Floor\"), there is a link to \"_Exit\" also labeled 24. This confirms these 24 patients were discharged alive and then exited.\n7.  There is another \"Discharge-Alive\" node in the diagram, but it is reached directly from \"Emergency\" (38 patients) and does not involve the \"Floor\". Therefore, this path is not relevant to the question.",
