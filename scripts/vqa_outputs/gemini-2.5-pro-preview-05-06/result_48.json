This means 38 patients followed this specific path segment.\n    *   These 38 patients then proceed from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"\\_Exit\" (as indicated by the link with label 38).\n    *   So, 38 patients were discharged alive via this pathway.\n\n3.  **Trace the second pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\":**\n    *   From \"Emergency\", other paths are taken. One relevant path segment is \"Emergency\" -> \"ICU\" (41 patients). Another is \"Emergency\" -> \"Floor\" (21 patients) -> \"ICU\" (21 patients). So, a total of 41 + 21 = 62 patients enter the \"ICU\" node.\n    *   From this \"ICU\" node, one path segment goes to \"Floor\". The link \"ICU\" -> \"Floor\" has a numeric label of 24. This \"Floor\" node is chronologically after the \"ICU\".\n    *   From this \"Floor\" node (that received 24 patients from ICU), a path goes to a second \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n    *   The link from this \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a numeric label of 24. This means 24 patients followed this specific path segment (ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive).\n    *   These 24 patients then proceed from this \"Discharge-Alive\" node to \"\\_Exit\" (as indicated by the link with label 24).\n    *   So, 24 patients were discharged alive via this pathway.\n\n4.  **Sum the counts from distinct pathways:**\n    *   The two pathways leading to a \"Discharge-Alive\" event are distinct:\n        *   Path 1: ... -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive (38 patients)\n        *   Path 2: ... -> Emergency -> ... -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive (24 patients)\n    *   Since these are separate groups of patients whose paths diverged (one group went directly from Emergency to Discharge-Alive, another group went through ICU and then Floor before being Discharged-Alive), the total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of these two counts.\n    *   Total patients discharged alive = 38 + 24.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total:**\n    *   38 + 24 = 62.\n\nThe diagram explicitly shows these two flows leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" events.
