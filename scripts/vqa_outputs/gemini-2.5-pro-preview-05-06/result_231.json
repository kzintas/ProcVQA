  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" event occurred immediately after a \"UNC Offense\" event.\n2.  I need to find all \"UNC Offense\" nodes in the diagram.\n3.  Then, for each \"UNC Offense\" node, I need to check if there is a directed link to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n4.  If such a link exists, I will note the numeric label on that link, which represents the count of sequences following that path.\n5.  Let's examine each column where \"UNC Offense\" appears:\n    *   **First column (leftmost):** There is a node \"_Start\" leading to \"UNC Offense\" (count 2). From this \"UNC Offense\" node, there is a directed link to \"Jump Ball\". The numeric label on this link is \"1\".\n    *   **Second column:** There is a node \"_Start\" leading to \"UNC Offense\" (count 19). From this \"UNC Offense\" node, the next event is \"Rebound\" (count 19). There is no \"Jump Ball\" event following this \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   **Third column:** There is a node \"_Start\" leading to \"UNC Offense\" (count 12). From this \"UNC Offense\" node, the next event is \"Foul\" (count 12). There is no \"Jump Ball\" event following this \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   **Fourth column:** There is a node \"_Start\" leading to \"UNC Offense\" (count 8). From this \"UNC Offense\" node, the next events are \"Turnover\" (count 5) and \"UMD Offense\" (count implied by the difference from 8 and other paths, but not directly relevant here as we are looking for \"Jump Ball\"). There is no \"Jump Ball\" event following this \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   **Fifth column (rightmost):** There is a node \"_Start\" leading to \"UNC Offense\" (count 28). From this \"UNC Offense\" node, the next events are \"Made Shot\" (count 20) and \"UMD Offense\" (count 25, but this is an aggregation from multiple \"UNC Offense\" actions, not a direct path from this specific one. The paths out of *this* UNC Offense are Made Shot (20) and the remainder leading to UMD Offense (28-20 = 8, if we consider all paths starting from this UNC Offense must sum to 28, or it leads to UMD Offense if it's a separate path from other UNC Offenses. The diagram implies direct paths from *this specific* UNC Offense are only to \"Made Shot\" or \"UMD Offense\" in this particular sequence segment). In any case, there is no \"Jump Ball\" event following this \"UNC Offense\".\n\n6.  The only instance where \"UNC Offense\" is directly followed by \"Jump Ball\" is in the first column, and the count for this specific sequence is 1.\n7.  Therefore, a jump ball occurred 1 time after UNC Offense.",
