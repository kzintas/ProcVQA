  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point of the relevant pathway:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *after* going to the \"Floor\". So, we start by locating the \"Floor\" node.\n2.  **Trace the path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\":** From the \"Floor\" node, there is a directed link going downwards to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n3.  **Identify the count on the link:** The numeric label next to the link connecting \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 24.\n4.  **Interpret the count:** This number (24) represents the count of sequences that follow the path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". Therefore, 24 patients went from the Floor and were subsequently discharged alive.",
