  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The question asks about events between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\", specifically involving \"Made Shot\". So the relevant nodes are \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2.  **Trace the path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\":**\n    *   Locate the node \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   Find the link originating from \"UNC Offense\" and leading to \"Made Shot\".\n    *   The numeric label on this link is 22. This indicates that there were 22 sequences where \"UNC Offense\" was followed by \"Made Shot\".\n\n3.  **Trace the path from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\":**\n    *   Locate the node \"Made Shot\".\n    *   Find the link originating from \"Made Shot\" and leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   The numeric label on this link is 22. This indicates that there were 22 sequences where \"Made Shot\" was followed by \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4.  **Confirm the sequence:** The question asks for \"made shots were *after* UNC Offense *but before* UMD offense\". This means we are looking for the sequence \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   The flow from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" is 22.\n    *   The flow from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 22.\n    *   Since these two values are the same, it means all 22 instances of \"Made Shot\" that followed \"UNC Offense\" then proceeded to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n5.  **Determine the count:** The number of \"Made Shot\" events that fit this criterion is the count on the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" (which is 22), which is consistent with the count on the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" (also 22). Therefore, there were 22 made shots that occurred after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\".",
