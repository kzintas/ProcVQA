  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant node:** The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. I locate the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace pathways to/from this node:**\n    *   There is a pathway from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a numeric label of 38. This indicates that 38 sequences (patients) went from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n    *   There is a pathway from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"\\_Exit\". The link from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"\\_Exit\" also has a numeric label of 38. This indicates that 38 sequences (patients) who were \"Discharge-Alive\" then proceeded to \"\\_Exit\".\n3.  **Determine the total count:** The number of patients who were discharged alive is represented by the flow through the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The incoming flow to this node is 38, and the outgoing flow is also 38. Both values consistently indicate that 38 patients were discharged alive.",
