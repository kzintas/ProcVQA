  "reasoning": "1.  The user is asking about the number of free throws made by \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  I need to examine the node-link diagram for any information related to \"free throws\" associated with the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n3.  The diagram displays event sequences. The nodes represent events: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\".\n4.  The links between nodes represent the flow of sequences, and the numbers on the links indicate the count of sequences following that path.\n5.  There are no nodes or labels in the diagram that explicitly mention \"free throws\". The events shown are high-level game phases or actions like \"Offense\" or \"Rebound\".\n6.  Since there is no information about \"free throws\" in the visualization, I cannot determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense.",
