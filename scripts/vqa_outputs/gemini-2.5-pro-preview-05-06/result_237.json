We need to scan the diagram for \"UNC Offense\" nodes and see if they lead to \"Made Shot\" nodes via directed links. The value on such a link will tell us the number of shots.\n\n4.  Examine each vertical strip/column:\n\n    *   **Column 1:**\n        *   Starts with `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2).\n        *   From `UNC Offense`, there are links:\n            *   `UNC Offense` -> `Jump Ball` (link value 1).\n            *   `UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` (link value 2).\n        *   Lower in this column, there is a `Made Shot` node.

While its placement in the \"UNC Offense\" column suggests it might be by UNC, the lack of an explicit link makes this attribution uncertain under the rule of following \"directed links forming pathways\".\n\n    *   **Column 2:**\n        *   Starts with `_Start` (19) -> `UNC Offense` (19).\n        *   `UNC Offense` leads to `Rebound` (19) and `Missed Shot` (19). No \"Made Shot\" directly by UNC Offense here.\n        *   Later in this column, there is a sequence `UMD Offense` (17) -> `Rebound` (15) -> `Made Shot` (8). This \"Made Shot\" (8) is explicitly part of a UMD Offense sequence, so it does not count towards UNC's made shots.\n\n    *   **Column 3:**\n        *   Starts with `_Start` (12) -> `UNC Offense` (12).\n        *   `UNC Offense` (12) -> `Foul` (12).\n        *   `Foul` (12) -> `Made Free Throw` (11). This is a \"Made Free Throw\", not a \"Made Shot\", so it's not relevant to the question. There's another `Made Free Throw` (3) linked from `UMD Offense` (10).\n\n    *   **Column 4:**\n        *   Starts with `_Start` (8) -> `UNC Offense` (8).\n        *   `UNC Offense` (8) -> `Turnover` (5). No \"Made Shot\" by UNC Offense here.\n\n    *   **Column 5:**\n        *   Starts with `_Start` (28) -> `UNC Offense` (28).\n        *   From this `UNC Offense` node, there is an explicit directed link: `UNC Offense` -> `Made Shot`. The numeric label next to this link is \"20\".\n        *   This explicitly shows 20 sequences where UNC Offense resulted in a Made Shot. The \"Made Shot\" node itself also has a bar with the value \"20\" next to it.\n\n5.  Consolidating the findings for \"Made Shot\" events by \"UNC Offense\" based on explicit directed links:\n    *   The only explicit pathway `UNC Offense` -> `Made Shot` is found in Column 5, with a count of 20 sequences.\n\n6.  The `Made Shot` (2) in Column 1: While it's in a column initiated by `UNC Offense`, the lack of a direct incoming link from `UNC Offense` means we cannot definitively attribute these 2 shots to UNC Offense *solely based on the explicitly shown pathways*. Adhering strictly to the instruction to use directed links for pathways, these 2 shots are not counted. If we were to infer based on column grouping, the answer might be different, but the instructions prioritize explicit links. The diagram also shows inconsistencies in counts (e.g., in column 1, `UNC Offense` (2) has outgoing links summing to 1+2=3), which warrants caution in making inferences beyond explicitly shown links and their counts.\n\n7.  Therefore, based solely on explicitly shown directed links forming pathways from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\", the total count is 20.",
