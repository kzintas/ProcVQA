  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks about shots made by \"UMD Offense\". So, we start at the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n2.  **Trace paths from \"UMD Offense\" that lead to \"Made Shot\":**\n    *   From \"UMD Offense\", there is a path to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n    *   From \"Rebound\", there is a path to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15. This means that 15 of the 34 sequences that went through \"UMD Offense\" then \"Rebound\" resulted in a \"Made Shot\".\n    *   From \"UMD Offense\", there is also a path to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14. This path does not lead to \"Made Shot\".\n    *   From \"UMD Offense\", there is a path to \"\\_Exit\" with a count of 21. This path does not lead to \"Made Shot\".\n3.  **Focus on the relevant path:** The only path from \"UMD Offense\" that leads to a \"Made Shot\" is: \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"Made Shot\".\n4.  **Determine the count:** The number of sequences following the path \"Rebound\" -> \"Made Shot\" is explicitly given by the label on the link, which is 15. Since all these sequences originated from \"UMD Offense\" (specifically, they are part of the 34 sequences that went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\"), this value directly represents the number of made shots by UMD offense that followed a rebound.\n5.  The diagram shows that all \"Made Shot\" events follow a \"Rebound\" which in turn follows \"UMD Offense\". The number of sequences going from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 15. This is the total number of \"Made Shot\" events that are traceable back to \"UMD Offense\".",
