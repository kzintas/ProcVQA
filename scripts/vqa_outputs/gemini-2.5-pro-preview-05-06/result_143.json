  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense.\n2.  I need to find the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram. It is present.\n3.  Next, I need to look for any outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" that lead to an event representing a \"Foul\".\n4.  Observing the diagram, the \"UMD Offense\" node has three outgoing paths:\n    *   One path leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n    *   Another path leads to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n    *   A third path leads to \"_Exit\" with a count of 21.\n5.  There is no node labeled \"Foul\" or any similar term that originates from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n6.  Since there is no event \"Foul\" shown as an outcome of \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram, the number of fouls cannot be determined from this visualization.",
