  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the target nodes:** The question asks for the total number of patients \"discharged alive\". We need to find all nodes labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram.\n2.  **Locate \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes and incoming links:**\n    *   There is one \"Discharge-Alive\" node on the right side of the diagram. The incoming link to this node is from \"Emergency\", and the numeric label on this link is 38. This means 38 sequences go from \"Emergency\" directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n    *   There is another \"Discharge-Alive\" node in the lower middle part of the diagram. The incoming link to this node is from \"Floor\", and the numeric label on this link is 24. This means 24 sequences go from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  **Sum the counts:** To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we sum the counts of sequences leading to these \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes.\n    *   Number of patients discharged alive from Emergency pathway = 38\n    *   Number of patients discharged alive from Floor pathway = 24\n    *   Total patients discharged alive = 38 + 24 = 62.\n4.  **Verify pathways:**\n    *   Path 1: _Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit. The link Emergency -> Discharge-Alive has a count of 38.\n    *   Path 2: _Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit. The link Floor -> Discharge-Alive has a count of 24.\n    *   These are the only two distinct pathways leading to a \"Discharge-Alive\" event.\n5.  Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of these two counts.",
