I need to find all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the diagram and sum the counts associated with these nodes. The numbers next to the node labels indicate the number of sequences passing through that specific event.\n\n1.  **Identify \"Missed Shot\" nodes and their counts:**\n    *   **In the first column (starting with `_Start 7`):**\n        *   There is a `Missed Shot` node after `UNC Offense`. The label is `Missed Shot 7`. This means 7 missed shots occurred here.\n        *   Further down in the same column, after `UMD Offense` followed by `Rebound`, there is another `Missed Shot` node. The label is `Missed Shot 6`. This means 6 missed shots occurred here.\n    *   **In the second column (starting with `_Start 14`):**\n        *   There is a `Missed Shot` node after `UNC Offense` followed by `Rebound`. The label is `Missed Shot 14`. This means 14 missed shots occurred here.\n    *   **In the third column (starting with `_Start 15`):**\n        *   There are no nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\".\n    *   **In the fourth column (starting with `_Start 5`):**\n        *   There are no nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\".\n    *   **In the fifth column (starting with `_Start 28`):**\n        *   There is a `Missed Shot` node after `UMD Offense`. The label is `Missed Shot 7`. This means 7 missed shots occurred here.\n\n2.  **Sum the counts for all identified \"Missed Shot\" events:**\n    *   From the first column: 7 + 6 = 13 missed shots.\n    *   From the second column: 14 missed shots.\n    *   From the fifth column: 7 missed shots.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total:**\n    *   Total missed shots = 7 (from column 1, first instance) + 6 (from column 1, second instance) + 14 (from column 2) + 7 (from column 5).\n    *   Total = 7 + 6 + 14 + 7 = 34.\n\nThe numbers next to the node labels (e.g., \"Missed Shot 7\") represent the number of sequences that include that specific event at that point. Therefore, summing these numbers for all \"Missed Shot\" events gives the total number of missed shots.",
