  "question": "How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "43",
  "llm_answer": "43",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify relevant nodes:** The question asks for the total number of rebounds made by both teams. I need to locate all nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Locate \"Rebound\" nodes and their values:**\n    *   In the third major vertical pathway (the one starting with `_Start 26`), there is a node labeled \"Rebound\" with a value of 26 next to it. This node follows \"UNC Offense\". The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" also shows a value of 26, and the node itself is displayed as \"Rebound 26\". This indicates 26 rebound events in sequences starting with UNC Offense.\n    *   Further down in the same third pathway, after \"UMD Offense 20\", there is another node labeled \"Rebound\" with a value of 17 next to it. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to this \"Rebound\" node shows a value of 17, and the node itself is displayed as \"Rebound 17\". This indicates 17 rebound events in sequences involving UMD Offense at that point.\n\n3.  **Sum the values:** To find the total number of rebounds, I will sum the values associated with all identified \"Rebound\" nodes.\n    *   Number of rebounds from the first instance = 26\n    *   Number of rebounds from the second instance = 17\n\n4.  **Calculate the total:**\n    *   Total rebounds = 26 + 17 = 43.\n\nTherefore, there were a total of 43 rebounds.",
