  "reasoning": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the total number of made shots by both teams, based on the provided node-link diagram.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Event Types:**\n    *   The diagram contains nodes labeled \"Made Shot\". These represent successful shots (typically field goals).\n    *   The diagram also contains nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\". These represent successful free throws.\n    *   In basketball, both a \"Made Shot\" (field goal) and a \"Made Free Throw\" are types of \"made shots\". Therefore, to find the total number of made shots, we need to sum the occurrences of both these event types.\n\n3.  **Locate and Sum \"Made Shot\" Events:**\n    *   In the first pathway (starting with `_Start 2`): There is a node \"UNC Offense (2)\" -> \"Missed Shot (2)\" -> \"Made Shot (2)\". This contributes 2 made shots.\n    *   In the third pathway (starting with `_Start 26`): There is a sequence \"UMD Offense (20)\" -> \"Rebound (17)\" -> \"Made Shot (9)\". This contributes 9 made shots (by UMD).\n    *   In the fourth pathway (starting with `_Start 21`): There is a node \"UNC Offense (21)\" -> \"Made Shot (20)\". This contributes 20 made shots.\n    *   Total count for \"Made Shot\" nodes = 2 + 9 + 20 = 31.\n\n4.  **Locate and Sum \"Made Free Throw\" Events:**\n    *   In the second pathway (starting with `_Start 13`): There is a sequence \"UNC Offense (13)\" -> \"Foul (13)\" -> \"Made Free Throw (12)\". This contributes 12 made free throws.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Made Shots:**\n    *   The total number of made shots is the sum of counts from \"Made Shot\" nodes and \"Made Free Throw\" nodes.\n    *   Total made shots = (Total from \"Made Shot\" nodes) + (Total from \"Made Free Throw\" nodes)\n    *   Total made shots = 31 + 12 = 43.\n\n6.  **Confirm \"by both teams\":**\n    *   The \"Made Shot (2)\" follows UNC Offense.\n    *   The \"Made Free Throw (12)\" follows a Foul during UNC Offense, implying UNC made these free throws.\n    *   The \"Made Shot (9)\" follows UMD Offense.\n    *   The \"Made Shot (20)\" follows UNC Offense.\n    *   The summation includes shots attributed to sequences initiated by both UNC Offense and UMD Offense, thus covering \"both teams\".\n\nThe interpretation counts all explicitly labeled \"Made Shot\" events and \"Made Free Throw\" events, as both represent shots that were successfully made. The term \"total made shots\" encompasses both types.",
