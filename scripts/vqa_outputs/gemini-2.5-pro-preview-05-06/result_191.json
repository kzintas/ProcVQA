  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the start and end points of the sub-sequence in question:** The question asks for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur *after* \"UNC Offense\" and *before* \"UMD Offense\". This means we are looking for the number of sequences that follow the path: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2.  **Locate the \"UNC Offense\" node:** This node is present in the diagram.\n\n3.  **Locate the \"Made Shot\" node:** This node is present in the diagram, chronologically after \"UNC Offense\".\n\n4.  **Examine the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\":** There is a directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\". The numeric label next to this link is \"22\". This indicates that 22 sequences transitioned from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\".\n\n5.  **Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node:** This node is present in the diagram, chronologically after \"Made Shot\".\n\n6.  **Examine the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\":** There is a directed link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". The numeric label next to this link is \"22\". This indicates that 22 sequences transitioned from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n7.  **Interpret the question:** \"How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?\" This refers to the number of times the event \"Made Shot\" occurred within the sequence \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\".\n\n8.  **Determine the count:** The number of sequences flowing from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" is 22. All of these 22 sequences then proceed from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, there were 22 instances of \"Made Shot\" that occurred after \"UNC Offense\" and were followed by \"UMD Offense\".",
