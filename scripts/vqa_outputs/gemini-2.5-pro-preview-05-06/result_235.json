  "question": "How many total missed shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "40",
  "llm_answer": "40",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify \"Missed Shot\" nodes:** The question asks for the total number of missed shots made by both teams. I need to locate all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Examine the first column:**\n    *   There is a \"Missed Shot\" node. The numeric label next to this node is \"2\". This indicates 2 sequences involved this \"Missed Shot\" event.\n\n3.  **Examine the second column:**\n    *   There is a \"Missed Shot\" node. The numeric label next to this node is \"19\". This indicates 19 sequences involved this \"Missed Shot\" event.\n\n4.  **Examine the third column:**\n    *   There is no \"Missed Shot\" node in this column.\n\n5.  **Examine the fourth column:**\n    *   There is no \"Missed Shot\" node in this column.\n\n6.  **Examine the fifth column:**\n    *   There is a \"Missed Shot\" node. The numeric label next to this node is \"19\". This indicates 19 sequences involved this \"Missed Shot\" event.\n\n7.  **Sum the counts:** To find the total number of missed shots, I sum the counts from each \"Missed Shot\" node identified:\n    *   From the first column: 2\n    *   From the second column: 19\n    *   From the fifth column: 19\n    *   Total = 2 + 19 + 19 = 40\n\nThe diagram shows three instances of \"Missed Shot\" events with counts 2, 19, and 19 respectively. The total number of missed shots is the sum of these counts.",
