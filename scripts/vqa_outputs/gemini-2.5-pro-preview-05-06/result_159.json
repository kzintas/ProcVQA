  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense.\n2.  I need to locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram. I found this node.\n3.  Next, I need to examine the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node to see if any of them represent a \"Foul\" event or lead to a node labeled \"Foul\".\n4.  The \"UMD Offense\" node has two outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node with a count of 34.\n    *   Another link goes to the \"_Exit\" node with a count of 35.\n5.  Neither of these outgoing paths from \"UMD Offense\" explicitly mentions \"Foul\" either in the link label or in the destination node label.\n6.  There is no other information in the diagram that indicates any \"Foul\" events are associated with \"UMD Offense\".\n7.  Therefore, based solely on the provided visualization, the number of fouls made by UMD Offense cannot be determined.",
