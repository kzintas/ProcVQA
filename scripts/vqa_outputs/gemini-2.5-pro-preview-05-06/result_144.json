  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks about the number of \"free throws\" made by UMD Offense.\n2.  First, I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n3.  From \"UMD Offense\", there are paths leading to \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n4.  The path to \"Rebound\" has a count of 34. From \"Rebound\", there is a path to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15. This represents 15 made shots following a rebound after a UMD Offense.\n5.  The path to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 14. This represents missed shots.\n6.  The diagram labels events as \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n7.  However, the diagram does not provide any information to distinguish between different types of shots, such as free throws, field goals (2-pointers or 3-pointers), etc. The label is simply \"Made Shot\".\n8.  Since the visualization does not specify whether these \"Made Shot\" events are \"free throws\", I cannot determine the number of free throws made. The information is not available in the diagram.",
