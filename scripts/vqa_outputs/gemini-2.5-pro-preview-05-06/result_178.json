  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** The question asks about \"Missed Shot\" events occurring before \"UMD Offense\". We need to locate these two nodes in the diagram.\n    *   The \"Missed Shot\" node is present.\n    *   The \"UMD Offense\" node is present.\n\n2.  **Trace the path:** We need to find pathways where \"Missed Shot\" directly precedes \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   There is a direct link from the \"Missed Shot\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n3.  **Read the link value:** The numeric label on the link connecting \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" indicates the number of sequences following this specific path.\n    *   The label on the link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is \"24\".\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** This means there are 24 sequences where a \"Missed Shot\" event is immediately followed by a \"UMD Offense\" event. The question asks \"How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?\", which directly corresponds to the number of sequences flowing from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".",
