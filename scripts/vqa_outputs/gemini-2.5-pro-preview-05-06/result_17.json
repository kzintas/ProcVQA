  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks for patients discharged alive *after going to the Floor*. So, we need to find the \"Floor\" node.\n2.  **Trace pathways from \"Floor\":** From the \"Floor\" node, there is one outgoing link.\n3.  **Identify the relevant pathway:** This outgoing link from \"Floor\" goes directly to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  **Read the link value:** The numeric label on the link connecting \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 24. This means 24 sequences (patients) went from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".",
