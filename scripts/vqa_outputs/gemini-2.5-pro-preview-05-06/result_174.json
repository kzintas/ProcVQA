  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Locate \"UMD Offense\" Node:** I first find the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Examine Outgoing Links and Subsequent Nodes:** I then examine all the direct paths (links) originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node and the nodes they lead to. These are:\n    *   UMD Offense -> _Exit (count: 27)\n    *   UMD Offense -> Rebound (count: 8)\n    *   UMD Offense -> Missed Shot (count: 16)\n    *   UMD Offense -> Foul (count: 7)\n\n3.  **Search for \"Steal\" Node:** I look for a node labeled \"Steal\" among these subsequent nodes. None of the nodes immediately following \"UMD Offense\" are labeled \"Steal\". In fact, there is no node labeled \"Steal\" anywhere in the provided diagram.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since there is no \"Steal\" node shown as an event directly following \"UMD Offense\", nor is \"Steal\" present as an event type anywhere in the diagram, the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense, based on the provided visualization, is 0.",
