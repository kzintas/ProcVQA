  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting event:** The question asks about events happening \"directly after a Rebound\". So, the first step is to locate the \"Rebound\" node in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Examine outgoing links from \"Rebound\":** Once the \"Rebound\" node is found, I need to look at all the directed links originating from it. These links will point to the events that occur directly after a \"Rebound\".\n    The diagram shows one outgoing link from \"Rebound\". This link goes to the \"_Exit\" node.\n\n3.  **Identify the \"shot made\" event:** The question asks for the number of \"shots made\". I need to check if any of the events following \"Rebound\" correspond to a \"shot made\".\n    The only event following \"Rebound\" is \"_Exit\". \"_Exit\" signifies the end of a sequence and is not a \"shot made\".\n    Furthermore, I need to scan all nodes in the diagram to see if an event explicitly labeled \"shot made\" (or a synonym) exists. The nodes are: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\". None of these represent a \"shot made\".\n\n4.  **Count the occurrences:** Since there is no node representing \"shot made\" in the diagram, and specifically no \"shot made\" event shown to occur directly after the \"Rebound\" event, the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, based *solely* on the provided visualization, is 0. The sequences after \"Rebound\" go to \"_Exit\", which is not a \"shot made\".\n\n5.  **Conclusion based on explicit information:** The instructions state to answer \"solely based on what is explicitly shown\". The diagram does not explicitly show any \"shot made\" event occurring after a \"Rebound\". Therefore, the count is 0. This is not \"indeterminate\" because the diagram clearly shows what happens after \"Rebound\" (it goes to \"_Exit\"), and \"shot made\" is not an event type depicted in this visualization. If it were a tracked event that occurred, it would be shown.",
