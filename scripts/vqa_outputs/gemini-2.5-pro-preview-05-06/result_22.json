  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about patients going to the \"Floor\" *after* the \"ICU\". So, the starting node of interest is \"ICU\".\n2.  **Locate the \"ICU\" node:** The \"ICU\" node is clearly visible in the diagram.\n3.  **Examine outgoing links from \"ICU\":** From the \"ICU\" node, there are three outgoing links:\n    *   One link goes to \"Die\" with a label \"36\".\n    *   One link goes to \"Floor\" with a label \"24\".\n    *   One link goes to \"_Exit\" with a label \"2\".\n4.  **Identify the relevant link:** The question specifically asks for the number of patients who went to the \"Floor\" after the \"ICU\". The link connecting \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" has the numeric label \"24\" next to it.\n5.  **Interpret the label:** This label \"24\" indicates that 24 sequences (patients, in this context) followed the path from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\".",
