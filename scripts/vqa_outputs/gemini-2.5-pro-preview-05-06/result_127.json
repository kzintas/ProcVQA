  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": "10",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about Fouls made by \"UMD Offense\". So, we start by locating the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace pathways to \"Foul\":** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, we look for direct or indirect pathways leading to a \"Foul\" node.\n3.  **Examine outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":**\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" with a count of 10.\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 8.\n    *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" with a count of 3.\n4.  **Identify the relevant link:** The link directly connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" represents the sequences where UMD Offense resulted in a Foul.\n5.  **Read the count on the link:** The numeric label on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" is 10. This indicates that there were 10 instances where a Foul occurred directly after UMD Offense.\n6.  **Check for other paths to Foul originating from UMD Offense:** There are no other pathways from \"UMD Offense\" that lead to a \"Foul\" event. The \"Foul\" node only has one incoming link, which is from \"UMD Offense\".\n\nTherefore, the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense is the count on the direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\".",
