  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The diagram shows that 100 sequences start at \"_Start\", proceed to \"Arrival\", and then to \"Emergency\".\n2.  From \"Emergency\", there are two branches:\n    *   62 sequences go to \"ICU\".\n    *   38 sequences go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  We are interested in patients who died after arriving at Emergency. Death is represented by the \"Die\" node.\n4.  The \"Die\" node is reached from the \"ICU\" node.\n5.  The path from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has 62 sequences.\n6.  From \"ICU\", 36 sequences proceed to \"Die\".\n7.  Therefore, 36 patients who arrived at Emergency, then went to ICU, subsequently died.\n8.  The other path from Emergency (to \"Discharge-Alive\") does not lead to \"Die\".",
