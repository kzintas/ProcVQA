  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the start node:** The question asks for sequences starting after \"UNC Offense\".\n2.  **Identify the intermediate event:** The event \"Made Shot\" must occur.\n3.  **Identify the end node before which the event must occur:** The event \"Made Shot\" must occur before \"UMD Offense\".\n4.  **Trace paths:**\n    *   Find the \"UNC Offense\" node.\n    *   Look for outgoing links from \"UNC Offense\" that lead to a \"Made Shot\" node. There is one such link: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" with a value of 22.\n    *   From this \"Made Shot\" node, check if there is a link leading to \"UMD Offense\". There is a link: \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 22.\n5.  **Confirm the sequence:** The sequence \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\" matches the criteria. The number of such sequences is indicated by the link values. The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" is 22, and the link from this \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is also 22. This means all 22 instances of \"Made Shot\" that occurred after \"UNC Offense\" also occurred before \"UMD Offense\".\n6.  **Consider other paths from UNC Offense:**\n    *   UNC Offense -> Rebound (15) -> Missed Shot (15) -> UMD Offense. This path does not include \"Made Shot\" directly after \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   UNC Offense -> Missed Shot (9) -> UMD Offense. This path involves \"Missed Shot\", not \"Made Shot\".\n    *   UNC Offense -> Foul (8) -> UMD Offense. This path involves \"Foul\", not \"Made Shot\".\n    *   UNC Offense -> UMD Offense (15). This path goes directly to \"UMD Offense\" without a \"Made Shot\".\n7.  The only relevant path is \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\". The number of sequences following the \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" link is 22. All these 22 sequences then proceed from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" as indicated by the link value of 22.\nTherefore, there were 22 made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD offense.",
