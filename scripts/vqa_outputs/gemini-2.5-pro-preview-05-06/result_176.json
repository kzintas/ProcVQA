  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about transitions *from* \"UNC Offense\". So, \"UNC Offense\" is our starting node.\n2.  **Identify the ending node:** The question asks about transitions *to* \"UMD Offense\". So, \"UMD Offense\" is our target node.\n3.  **Locate the direct link:** We need to find if there is a direct link (an arrow) going from the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n4.  **Examine the diagram:**\n    *   The node \"_Start\" has a link with the value 69 going to \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   From \"UNC Offense\", there are three outgoing links:\n        *   One link goes to \"Made Shot\" with a value of 22.\n        *   One link goes to \"Rebound\" with a value of 15.\n        *   One link goes directly to \"UMD Offense\".\n5.  **Read the value on the identified link:** The numeric label next to the link connecting \"UNC Offense\" directly to \"UMD Offense\" is 23.\n6.  **Conclusion:** This value represents the number of times the sequence \"UNC Offense\" -> \"UMD Offense\" occurred.",
