  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about patients arriving at 'Emergency'. I locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify the target node:** The question asks for patients who were 'discharged alive' *directly* after 'Emergency'. I look for a 'Discharge-Alive' node connected directly from the 'Emergency' node.\n3.  **Trace the path and find the count:**\n    *   From the 'Emergency' node, there is a direct link to a 'Discharge-Alive' node on the right side of the diagram.\n    *   The numeric label on this link, indicating the number of sequences (patients) following this path, is 38.\n4.  Therefore, 38 patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
