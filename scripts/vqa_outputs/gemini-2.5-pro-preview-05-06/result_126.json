  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks about shots made by \"UMD Offense\". We need to find the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Trace paths leading to \"Made Shot\" from \"UMD Offense\":** We need to identify all sequences of events that start from \"UMD Offense\" and result in a \"Made Shot\".\n\n3.  **Path 1: Direct Made Shot:**\n    *   There is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n    *   The numeric label on this link is 8.\n    *   This means there were 8 sequences where UMD Offense directly resulted in a Made Shot.\n\n4.  **Path 2: Made Shot after a Rebound:**\n    *   There is a path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The link \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" has a value of 34. This means 34 sequences involved a rebound during UMD's offense.\n    *   From the \"Rebound\" node, there is a link to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n    *   The numeric label on the link \"Rebound\" -> \"Made Shot\" is 15.\n    *   This means that out of the sequences that went to \"Rebound\", 15 of them subsequently resulted in a \"Made Shot\". These are 15 made shots that occurred after a rebound during UMD's offensive possession.\n\n5.  **Sum the made shots:** To find the total number of shots made by UMD Offense, we sum the counts from these distinct pathways leading to a \"Made Shot\".\n    *   Made shots directly: 8\n    *   Made shots after a rebound: 15\n    *   Total made shots = 8 + 15 = 23.\n\n6.  **Verify no other paths:** We check if there are any other paths from \"UMD Offense\" leading to a \"Made Shot\". The outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" are to \"Rebound\" (34), \"Missed Shot\" (14), \"Foul\" (10), \"Made Shot\" (8), and \"_Exit\" (3). The only other node that could potentially lead to a \"Made Shot\" is \"Rebound\", which we have already considered. \"Missed Shot\" and \"Foul\" do not lead to \"Made Shot\" in this diagram.\n\nTherefore, the total number of made shots by UMD offense is the sum of the made shots from the direct path and the made shots from the rebound path.",
