This indicates that 38 sequences follow this specific path to being discharged alive.\n    *   The link from this \"Discharge-Alive\" node to \"_Exit\" also confirms this count with a label of 38.\n\n3.  **Trace the second pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\":**\n    *   The path is _Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit.\n    *   The link from \"Floor\" (which is after \"ICU\") to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a numeric label of 24. This indicates that 24 sequences follow this specific path to being discharged alive.\n    *   The link from this \"Discharge-Alive\" node to \"_Exit\" also confirms this count with a label of 24.\n\n4.  **Sum the counts from all \"Discharge-Alive\" instances:**\n    *   Number of patients discharged alive from the first pathway = 38.\n    *   Number of patients discharged alive from the second pathway = 24.\n    *   Total patients discharged alive = 38 + 24.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total:**\n    *   38 + 24 = 62.",
