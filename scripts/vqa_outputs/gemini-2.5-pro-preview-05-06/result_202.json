  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node**: The question asks about events occurring after \"UMD Offense\". I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n\n2.  **Examine outgoing links and subsequent nodes**: From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are two direct outgoing paths:\n    *   One path leads to the \"Rebound\" node, with a count of 34 sequences.\n    *   Another path leads to the \"_Exit\" node, with a count of 22 sequences.\n\n3.  **Search for \"Steal\" event**: I need to determine how many \"steals\" occurred. I scan all the nodes in the diagram: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", \"_Exit\". The event \"Steal\" is not represented as a node in this diagram.\n\n4.  **Conclusion based on available information**: Since \"Steal\" is not an event type shown or tracked in this specific node-link diagram, it is impossible to determine how many steals occurred after \"UMD Offense\" based solely on the provided visualization. The diagram only accounts for the events explicitly depicted. There is no information about steals. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined.",
