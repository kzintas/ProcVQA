First, I need to locate a node labeled \"Floor\" in the provided diagram.\n3.  I scan all the nodes in the diagram: \"_Start\", \"Arrival\", \"Emergency\", \"ICU\", \"Die\", \"_Exit\", and \"Discharge-Alive\".\n4.  There is no node labeled \"Floor\" in the diagram.\n5.  Since the \"Floor\" node is not present, it is impossible to determine the number of patients who went to the \"Floor\" and were subsequently \"Discharge-Alive\" based solely on the provided visualization.",
