  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify \"Made Shot\" nodes:** The first step is to locate all nodes in the diagram labeled \"Made Shot\".\n2.  **Examine incoming links and counts:** For each \"Made Shot\" node, we need to look at the incoming links and their associated numeric labels, which represent the number of sequences leading to that event.\n3.  **First occurrence of \"Made Shot\":**\n    *   In the second major vertical pathway (starting with `_Start 14`), there is a node \"Made Shot\".\n    *   The link leading into this \"Made Shot\" node originates from \"Rebound\" (which itself has 11 sequences coming into it from \"UMD Offense\").\n    *   The numeric label on the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 7. This means there are 7 sequences where a \"Made Shot\" occurred at this point.\n4.  **Second occurrence of \"Made Shot\":**\n    *   In the sixth major vertical pathway (starting with `_Start 25`), there is a node \"Made Shot\".\n    *   The link leading into this \"Made Shot\" node originates from \"UNC Offense\".\n    *   The numeric label on the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" is 21.

The question specifically asks for \"Made Shot\", so \"Made Free Throw\" events are not included in this count. The diagram shows \"Made Free Throw\" with counts 13 and 8, but these are separate from \"Made Shot\".",
