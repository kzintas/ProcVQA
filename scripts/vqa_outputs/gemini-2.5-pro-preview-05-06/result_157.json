  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the \"Rebound\" node:** The visualization shows a node labeled \"Rebound\".\n2.  **Examine outgoing links from \"Rebound\":** There is one outgoing link from the \"Rebound\" node.\n3.  **Identify the destination node and count:** This link goes to a node labeled \"\\_Exit\". The numeric label on this link is 34. This means that 34 sequences proceeded from \"Rebound\" directly to \"\\_Exit\".\n4.  **Check for \"shots made\" node:** The question asks for the number of \"shots made\" directly after a \"Rebound\". The diagram does not contain any node explicitly labeled \"shots made\" or any equivalent term that would represent a shot being made. The \"\\_Exit\" node simply indicates the end of the observed sequence, not necessarily a specific event like a \"shot made\".\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since there is no information in the diagram about \"shots made\" as a distinct event following \"Rebound\", the answer cannot be determined from the visualization. The diagram only shows that after a \"Rebound\", 34 sequences go to \"\\_Exit\". We cannot infer what \"\\_Exit\" represents in terms of specific game actions like \"shot made\".",
