  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about events *after* \"UMD Offense\". So, I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify the target event:** The question asks for the number of \"rebounds\". So, I look for a \"Rebound\" node that follows \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  **Trace the path:** I look for a directed link from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Rebound\" node.\n4.  **Find the count:** There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The numeric label on this link is 34.\n5.  This means that 34 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" directly to \"Rebound\".",
