  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor. I need to analyze the provided node-link diagrams to find sequences of events where a \"Floor\" event is followed by a \"Discharge-Alive\" event.\n\n1.  **Identify relevant nodes**: The key nodes are \"Floor\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" (or variations like \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\").\n\n2.  **Examine each diagram for the required sequence**:\n    *   **Diagram 1 (starts with 12 patients):**\n        *   Path: _Start -> Arrival (12) -> Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die _Exit (12)\n        *   This diagram does not contain a \"Floor\" node. Thus, it contributes 0 to the count.\n\n    *   **Diagram 2 (starts with 37 patients):**\n        *   Path: _Start -> Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive _Exit (37)\n        *   This diagram contains a \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\" node, but it does not contain a \"Floor\" node.
