All sequences related to UMD offense originate from or pass through this node.\n\n2.  **Trace paths leading to \"Made Shot\" from \"UMD Offense\":** We need to find all sequences starting from \"UMD Offense\" that result in a \"Made Shot\" event.\n\n    *   **Path 1: Direct Made Shot**\n        *   There is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n        *   The numeric label on this link is 8. This means there were 8 sequences where UMD Offense directly resulted in a Made Shot.\n\n    *   **Path 2: Made Shot after a Rebound**\n        *   There is a link from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 34. This means 34 sequences from UMD Offense led to a Rebound.\n        *   From this \"Rebound\" node, there is a link to another \"Made Shot\" node.\n        *   The numeric label on the link from \"Rebound\" to this \"Made Shot\" node is 15. This means that out of the sequences that involved a Rebound during UMD Offense, 15 of them subsequently resulted in a Made Shot. These are also considered shots made by UMD Offense as the rebound likely maintained possession.\n\n3.  **Check for other paths:**\n    *   UMD Offense -> Missed Shot (14): This is not a made shot.\n    *   UMD Offense -> Foul (10):\n        *   Foul -> Made Free Throw (6): This is a \"Made Free Throw\", not a \"Made Shot\". The question specifically asks for \"shots made\", referring to the \"Made Shot\" event.\n        *   Foul -> \\_Exit (4)\n    *   UMD Offense -> \\_Exit (3): This terminates the sequence without a made shot.\n    *   UMD Offense -> Rebound (34) -> Missed Shot (9): Not a made shot.\n    *   UMD Offense -> Rebound (34) -> Foul (6):\n        *   Foul -> Made Free Throw (4): Not a \"Made Shot\".\n        *   Foul -> \\_Exit (2)\n    *   UMD Offense -> Rebound (34) -> Turnover (4): Not a made shot.\n\n4.  **Sum the counts of \"Made Shot\" events:**\n    *   The number of \"Made Shot\" events directly from \"UMD Offense\" is 8.\n    *   The number of \"Made Shot\" events following a \"Rebound\" (which originated from \"UMD Offense\") is 15.\n\n5.  **Total Calculation:**\n    *   Total \"Made Shot\" events by UMD Offense = (Direct Made Shots) + (Made Shots after Rebound)\n    *   Total = 8 + 15 = 23.\n\nThe visualization explicitly provides these pathways and counts.",
