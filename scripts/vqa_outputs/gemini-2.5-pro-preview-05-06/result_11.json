  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting point:** The question asks about patients discharged alive *after* going to the \"Floor\". So, we start by locating the \"Floor\" node.\n2.  **Trace paths from \"Floor\":** From the \"Floor\" node, there is one outgoing path.\n3.  **Identify the relevant path:** This path leads to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n4.  **Read the link value:** The numeric label on the link connecting \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 24.\n5.  **Confirm the endpoint:** This path (Floor -> Discharge-Alive) represents patients who went to the Floor and were subsequently discharged alive.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The value 24 on this link indicates that 24 patients followed this specific sequence.",
