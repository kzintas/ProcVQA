  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense.\n2.  To answer this, I need to find the node \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n3.  Once \"UMD Offense\" is located, I need to examine the outgoing links from this node.\n4.  The outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" lead to the following nodes: \"Rebound\" (with a count of 34), \"Missed Shot\" (with a count of 14), and \"\\_Exit\" (with a count of 21).\n5.  I need to look for an outgoing link from \"UMD Offense\" to a node labeled \"Foul\" or a similar term indicating a foul.\n6.  Upon careful inspection of the diagram, there is no node labeled \"Foul\" that directly follows \"UMD Offense\".\n7.  Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the visualization, the number of Fouls made by UMD Offense cannot be determined.",
