  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify Relevant Nodes:** The question asks for the number of free throws made by UMD Offense. We need to find \"Made Free Throw\" events in the diagram and determine if they were made by UMD Offense.\n\n2.  **Locate \"Made Free Throw\" Events:**\n    *   In the fifth column from the left, there is a sequence starting with `_Start (15) -> UNC Offense (15) -> Foul (15)`.\n    *   Following the \"Foul\" node (committed by UNC Offense), there is a node `Made Free Throw` with a count of 13.\n    *   Following this first `Made Free Throw (13)` node, there is another `Made Free Throw` node with a count of 8.\n\n3.  **Attribute Free Throws to UMD Offense:**\n    *   The sequence shows that \"UNC Offense\" committed a \"Foul\".\n    *   In basketball, when one team fouls, the opposing team is typically awarded free throws.\n    *   The diagram features \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" as the two teams. Therefore, if UNC Offense fouls, UMD Offense would be the team to shoot and make the free throws.\n    *   Thus, the \"Made Free Throw\" events following the \"Foul\" by \"UNC Offense\" are attributable to UMD Offense.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Counts of \"Made Free Throw\" Events:**\n    *   The first `Made Free Throw` node has a count of 13. This means that in 13 sequences, a first (or potentially only) free throw was made by UMD Offense. This accounts for 13 successfully made free throws.\n    *   The second `Made Free Throw` node has a count of 8. This node follows the first `Made Free Throw` node, indicating that in 8 of those sequences where a first free throw was made, a second free throw was also made by UMD Offense. This accounts for an additional 8 successfully made free throws.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Made Free Throws by UMD Offense:**\n    *   The total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is the sum of the counts of these distinct \"Made Free Throw\" events attributed to them.\n    *   Number of first free throws made = 13.\n    *   Number of second free throws made = 8.\n    *   Total made free throws by UMD Offense = 13 + 8 = 21.\n\n    Alternatively, this can be viewed as:\n    *   There are 8 sequences where two free throws were made by UMD (8 sequences * 2 FTs/sequence = 16 FTs).\n    *   There are (13 - 8) = 5 sequences where only one free throw was made by UMD (5 sequences * 1 FT/sequence = 5 FTs).\n    *   Total made free throws = 16 + 5 = 21.\n    Both interpretations lead to the same result. The simpler interpretation is that the node \"Made Free Throw (13)\" represents 13 individual made shots, and \"Made Free Throw (8)\" represents another 8 distinct individual made shots.\n\n6.  **Verify No Other Instances:** A scan of the entire diagram confirms that these are the only \"Made Free Throw\" events shown. There are no other sequences leading to \"Made Free Throw\" that could be attributed to UMD Offense.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the explicit information in the visualization and standard interpretation of basketball event terminology, UMD Offense made 21 free throws.",
