  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks for rebounds made *after* \"UMD Offense\". So, the \"UMD Offense\" node is our starting point for this analysis.\n2.  **Locate \"UMD Offense\" node:** I find the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n3.  **Examine outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":** There are two outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n    *   One link goes to the \"Rebound\" node.\n    *   Another link goes to the \"\\_Exit\" node.\n4.  **Identify the relevant link:** The question is specifically about \"rebounds\". So, I focus on the link going from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n5.  **Read the value on the link:** The numeric label on the link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is 34. This value represents the number of sequences where \"Rebound\" occurred immediately after \"UMD Offense\".",
