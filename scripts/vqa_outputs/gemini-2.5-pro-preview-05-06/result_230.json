I need to identify all \"Made Shot\" events that can be attributed to \"UNC Offense\".\n\n1.  **Understanding the Diagram:**\n    *   Each vertical column represents a set of sequences starting with \"_Start\".\n    *   Nodes represent events, and links show the flow.\n    *   Numbers next to node labels (e.g., \"UNC Offense 2\", \"Made Shot 28\") indicate the count of sequences passing through that node in that specific context/column.\n    *   The question requires finding \"Made Shot\" events that occurred when UNC was on offense.\n\n2.  **Analyzing each column for UNC Made Shots:**\n\n    *   **Column 1 (starts with _Start 2):**\n        *   Path: _Start (2) -> UNC Offense (2)\n        *   From \"UNC Offense (2)\", one relevant path is: UNC Offense (2) -> Missed Shot (2).\n        *   From \"Missed Shot (2)\", there's a path: Missed Shot (2) -> Made Shot (2).\n        *   This sequence is: UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> Made Shot.

If it were a UMD shot, the diagram should ideally show a transition to \"UMD Offense\" first, as it does in other columns.\n        *   So, these 2 \"Made Shot\" events are attributed to UNC.\n\n    *   **Column 2 (starts with _Start 19):**\n        *   Path: _Start (19) -> UNC Offense (19)\n        *   From \"UNC Offense (19)\", possible next events are \"Rebound (19)\", \"Missed Shot (19)\", and \"UMD Offense (17)\".\n        *   The paths \"UNC Offense -> Rebound\" and \"UNC Offense -> Missed Shot\" do not show a subsequent \"Made Shot\" for UNC in this column.\n        *   The path \"UNC Offense -> UMD Offense (17)\" indicates a change of possession.\n        *   Following \"UMD Offense (17)\", there is \"Made Shot (7)\". These 7 shots are made by UMD, not UNC.\n        *   So, no \"Made Shot\" events are attributed to UNC from this column.\n\n    *   **Column 3 (starts with _Start 33):**\n        *   Path: _Start (33) -> UNC Offense (33)\n        *   From \"UNC Offense (33)\", there is a direct path: UNC Offense (33) -> Made Shot (28).\n        *   This \"Made Shot (28)\" directly follows \"UNC Offense\", clearly indicating these 28 shots were made by UNC.\n        *   Other paths from \"UNC Offense (33)\" are to \"UMD Offense (26)\" (change of possession) and \"Missed Shot (18)\" (which doesn't lead to a UNC made shot in this branch).\n        *   So, 28 \"Made Shot\" events are attributed to UNC from this column.\n\n    *   **Column 4 (starts with _Start 15):**\n        *   Path: _Start (15) -> UNC Offense (15)\n        *   From \"UNC Offense (15)\", paths lead to \"Foul (15)\" and \"UMD Offense (11)\".\n        *   \"Foul\" is not explicitly linked to \"Made Shot\".
