  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the starting node:** The question asks about patients going to ICU *after* Emergency. So, the starting node for our analysis is \"Emergency\".\n2.  **Identify the target node:** The question asks how many patients went to the \"ICU\". So, the target node is \"ICU\".\n3.  **Locate the link:** I need to find the directed link from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"ICU\" node.\n4.  **Read the link value:** The visualization shows a link originating from \"Emergency\" and pointing towards \"ICU\". The numeric label next to this link indicates the number of sequences (patients in this context) following this path. The value on this link is 62.\n5.  Therefore, 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.",
