  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n2.  I need to examine the provided node-link diagram to find information about \"free throws\" specifically related to \"UMD Offense\".\n3.  The nodes in the diagram are: \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\".\n4.  The links show the flow and count of sequences between these events. For example, there are 69 sequences from \"_Start\" to \"UNC Offense\", and 69 sequences from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". From \"UMD Offense\", 34 sequences go to \"Rebound\", and 35 sequences go directly to \"_Exit\".\n5.  I need to check if any of these nodes or the labels on the links provide information about \"free throws\".\n6.  The node \"UMD Offense\" represents a general offensive possession or event by UMD.\n7.  There are no sub-nodes or branches from \"UMD Offense\" (or any other node) that are labeled \"Free Throw\" or \"Free Throws Made\".\n8.  The diagram only shows the sequence of broader game events (like an offensive possession by a team, a rebound, or the end of a sequence) and the frequency of these sequences. It does not break down what happens *within* an \"Offense\" event, such as specific scoring actions like \"free throws\".\n9.  Therefore, the diagram does not contain the specific information required to answer how many free throws were made by UMD Offense.",
