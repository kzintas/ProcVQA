  "full_response": "You are a good assistant who can retrieve information and provide answers from node-link diagram visualizations. \n    \n## Context You are presented with a node-link diagram visualization that shows sequences of events: \n- Each event is represented by a node with a label \n- Events are connected by directed links forming pathways \n- The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom) \n- Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path \n- Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences \n\n## Instructions \n- Carefully examine all nodes, links, labels, and their corresponding values \n- Track complete pathways through the diagram to understand event sequences \n- Answer **solely** based on what is explicitly shown in the visualization \n- If the answer **cannot be determined** from the visualization, respond with 'indeterminate' \n\n## Response Format \n1. Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer \n2. Describe your thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>, showing how you analyzed the diagram \n3. After your detailed explanation, provide your final answer in the following format: <answer>X</answer> where X is your direct answer or 'indeterminate'\n\n\n\nAnalyze the node-link diagram shown in the figure and answer the following question.\n## Question \nHow many patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?\n    ## Relevant Elements in the Visualization\n- Nodes: Start, Arrival, Emergency, ICU, Die, Floor, Discharge-Alive, _Exit\n- Links: Start to Arrival (100), Arrival to Emergency (100), Emergency to ICU (62), Emergency to Discharge-Alive (38), ICU to Die (36), ICU to Floor (24), Floor to Discharge-Alive (24), Discharge-Alive to _Exit (38)\n\n## Thought Process and Calculations\n1. Start with 100 patients at the \"Arrival\" node.\n2. All 100 patients proceed to \"Emergency\".\n3. From \"Emergency\", 62 patients go to \"ICU\".\n4. The number of patients going to \"ICU\" after \"Emergency\" is explicitly shown as 62.\n\n## Final Answer\n<answer>62</answer>",
