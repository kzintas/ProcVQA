  "full_response": "You are a good assistant who can retrieve information and provide answers from node-link diagram visualizations. \n    \n## Context You are presented with a node-link diagram visualization that shows sequences of events: \n- Each event is represented by a node with a label \n- Events are connected by directed links forming pathways \n- The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom) \n- Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path \n- Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences \n\n## Instructions \n- Carefully examine all nodes, links, labels, and their corresponding values \n- Track complete pathways through the diagram to understand event sequences \n- Answer **solely** based on what is explicitly shown in the visualization \n- If the answer **cannot be determined** from the visualization, respond with 'indeterminate' \n\n## Response Format \n1.
