  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The diagram illustrates event sequences starting from \"_Start\" and ending at \"_Exit\".\n- We focus on the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n- \"UNC Offense\" is followed by either \"Made Shot\" (23 sequences) or \"Missed Shot\" (24 sequences).\n- \"Missed Shot\" is directly linked to \"UMD Offense\" with 24 sequences.\n- Therefore, the number of missed shots before \"UMD Offense\" is directly given by the count on the link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", which is 24.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of missed shots before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes and links between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". Specifically, we need to look at the paths from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\", and then from these nodes to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: \n   - The diagram shows that from \"UNC Offense\", there are two possible paths: to \"Made Shot\" and to \"Missed Shot\". \n   - The count associated with \"Made Shot\" is 23, and with \"Missed Shot\" is 24.\n\n3. **Determine Missed Shots Before UMD Offense**:\n   - To reach \"UMD Offense\", the path must go through either \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\" because these are the only two nodes directly connected to \"UNC Offense\" and leading towards \"UMD Offense\".\n   - The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a count of 24, indicating that 24 sequences involved a missed shot before proceeding to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4. **Calculate Total Missed Shots Before UMD Offense**:\n   - Since the question asks for the number of missed shots before \"UMD Offense\", we directly observe that the count associated with the link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 24.\n\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning\n<reasoning>\n- The diagram illustrates event sequences starting from \"_Start\" and ending at \"_Exit\".\n- We focus on the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n- \"UNC Offense\" is followed by either \"Made Shot\" (23 sequences) or \"Missed Shot\" (24 sequences).\n- \"Missed Shot\" is directly linked to \"UMD Offense\" with 24 sequences.\n- Therefore, the number of missed shots before \"UMD Offense\" is directly given by the count on the link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", which is 24.\n</reasoning>\n\n## Final Answer\n<answer>24</answer>",
