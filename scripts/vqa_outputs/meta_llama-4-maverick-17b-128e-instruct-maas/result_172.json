  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "49",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram provides a visual representation of the sequences of events in the match. By examining the links connected to the \"Rebound\" nodes under both \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\", we can directly count the number of rebounds. The counts are explicitly shown next to the links, making it straightforward to calculate the total.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the nodes and links related to rebounds.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows two instances of \"Rebound\" nodes, one under \"UNC Offense\" and another under \"UMD Offense\". We will analyze the links connected to these nodes.\n\n2. **Count Rebounds for UNC Offense**: The \"Rebound\" node under \"UNC Offense\" has a link coming into it with a count of 8.\n\n3. **Count Rebounds for UMD Offense**: The \"Rebound\" node under \"UMD Offense\" has a link coming into it with a count of 7.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Rebounds**: To find the total number of rebounds, we add the counts from both \"Rebound\" nodes. total_rebounds = 8 (from UNC Offense) + 7 (from UMD Offense) = 15\n\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram provides a visual representation of the sequences of events in the match.
