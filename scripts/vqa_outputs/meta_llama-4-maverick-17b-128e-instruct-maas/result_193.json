  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The total number of rebounds can be directly obtained from the link leading to the \"Rebound\" node. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with 34, which represents the count of sequences that resulted in a rebound.",
  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows sequences of events in a match, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links. The link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences.\n\nTo determine the total number of rebounds, we need to examine the node labeled \"Rebound\" and its incoming link.\n\n1. Identify the relevant elements in the visualization: The node \"Rebound\" and its incoming link from \"UMD Offense\" are relevant.\n2. Describe the thought process and calculations: The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a numeric label of 34, indicating that 34 sequences followed this path.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of rebounds can be directly obtained from the link leading to the \"Rebound\" node. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with 34, which represents the count of sequences that resulted in a rebound.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
