  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The relevant elements in the visualization are the \"Missed Shot\" nodes and their corresponding counts. We identified these nodes in different sequences and summed their counts. The counts are 7, 14, 6, and 7. Summing these values gives us the total number of missed shots.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant nodes and links.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game between UNC and UMD. We are interested in the \"Missed Shot\" nodes as they directly relate to the question.\n\n2. **Count Missed Shots for Each Team**: \n   - For the sequence starting with 7, we see \"Missed Shot\" (count = 7) and another \"Missed Shot\" (count = 6), indicating missed shots by both teams.\n   - For the sequence starting with 14, \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 14.\n   - For the sequence starting with 5, there's no direct \"Missed Shot\" count, but we see a count of 7 under \"Missed Shot\" in the sequence starting with 28.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Missed Shots**:\n   - From the sequence starting with 7: 7 (Missed Shot) + 6 (Missed Shot) = 13 missed shots.\n   - From the sequence starting with 14: 14 (Missed Shot).\n   - From the sequence starting with 28: 7 (Missed Shot).\n\n4. **Sum the Counts**: Adding the counts of missed shots from all relevant sequences gives us the total number of missed shots. total_missed_shots = 7 + 14 + 6 + 7 = 34.\n\n**Reasoning**: We analyzed the node-link diagram, identified the \"Missed Shot\" nodes, and summed their counts to find the total number of missed shots made by both teams.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe relevant elements in the visualization are the \"Missed Shot\" nodes and their corresponding counts. We identified these nodes in different sequences and summed their counts. The counts are 7, 14, 6, and 7. Summing these values gives us the total number of missed shots.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
