  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "49",
  "llm_answer": "30",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram illustrates the sequence of events in a match, with specific counts for each transition between events. We identified two instances of \"Rebound\" and noted the counts associated with them. By summing these counts (15 for the first \"Rebound\" and 15 for the second \"Rebound\"), we calculated the total number of rebounds.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to examine the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events with nodes and directed links. The relevant nodes for rebounds are labeled \"Rebound\" and appear twice in the diagram.\n\n2. **Extract Rebound Information**: \n   - The first \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"UNC Offense\" with a link width labeled '15'. This indicates that there are 15 sequences where a rebound occurs after \"UNC Offense\".\n   - The second \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"UMD Offense\" with a link width labeled '15'. This indicates that there are 15 sequences where a rebound occurs after \"UMD Offense\".\n\n3. **Calculate Total Rebounds**: To find the total number of rebounds, we add the counts associated with both \"Rebound\" nodes.\n   - Total Rebounds = Rebounds after UNC Offense + Rebounds after UMD Offense\n   - Total Rebounds = 15 + 15\n\n4. **Perform Calculation**:\n   - Total Rebounds = 30\n\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram illustrates the sequence of events in a match, with specific counts for each transition between events. We identified two instances of \"Rebound\" and noted the counts associated with them. By summing these counts (15 for the first \"Rebound\" and 15 for the second \"Rebound\"), we calculated the total number of rebounds.\n</reasoning>\n\n## Final Answer\n<answer>30</answer>",
