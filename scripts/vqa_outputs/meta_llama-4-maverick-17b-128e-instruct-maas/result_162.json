  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "60",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant nodes**: The nodes representing \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" are crucial for answering this question.\n   \n2. **Examine the links between the nodes**: We need to look at the directed links from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". The diagram shows that there are three types of events that lead to a transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\": \"Rebound\", \"Turnover\", and \"Made Shot\" followed by no direct link, but \"Turnover\" is a direct link.\n\n3. **Count the sequences**: The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is labeled with counts corresponding to different events. Specifically, the counts are associated with \"Rebound\" (23), \"Turnover\" (24), and \"Made Shot\" (4). However, the direct count from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is not explicitly shown; instead, we see the counts for the events leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4. **Calculate the total transitions**: The total number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense can be derived by summing the counts of the events that directly lead to \"UMD Offense\". The relevant counts are 27 (Turnover) and 23 (Rebound) and 4 (Made Shot), which are the counts on the links leading to \"UMD Offense\". However, the correct interpretation is to look at the links directly from \"UNC Offense\" to the subsequent events and then to \"UMD Offense\". The counts are 8 (to Foul), 4 (to Made Shot), 23 (to Rebound), and 24 (to Turnover), but the direct link to \"UMD Offense\" is what we are interested in. The count on the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is not directly available; we infer from the subsequent events.\n\n5. **Direct counts**: The diagram directly shows that 8 sequences went from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Foul\", 4 to \"Made Shot\", 23 to \"Rebound\", and 24 to \"Turnover\". The count for transitioning to \"UMD Offense\" is labeled as 8.\n\n## Step-by-step analysis:\n- The count for \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is directly related to the count labeled on the link between them or the events that directly precede \"UMD Offense\".\n- The count is **8**.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>8</answer>",
