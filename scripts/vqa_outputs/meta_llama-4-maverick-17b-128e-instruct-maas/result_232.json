  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "19",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes representing \"UNC Offense\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\". We need to track the pathways from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" and count the number of \"Missed Shot\" events in between.\n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: \n   - The diagram shows multiple pathways starting from \"_Start\" and transitioning through \"UNC Offense\".\n   - We observe that after \"UNC Offense\", there are several possible next events, including \"Rebound\", \"Foul\", and directly to \"Missed Shot\" or \"Made Shot\".\n   - The pathway relevant to our question involves \"Missed Shot\" occurring after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n3. **Count Missed Shots**: \n   - In the second column, we see \"Rebound\" followed by \"Missed Shot\" (19 times), indicating a sequence where \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\".\n   - In the fifth column, \"Missed Shot\" (19 times) directly follows \"UNC Offense\", showing another sequence where \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4. **Calculate Total Missed Shots**: \n   - We sum the counts of \"Missed Shot\" that occur after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\". \n   - From the diagram, we have 19 (from the second column) and 19 (from the fifth column), totaling 38 missed shots.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - By analyzing the pathways and counting the \"Missed Shot\" events between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\", we find that there are 19 + 19 = 38 missed shots.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>38</answer>",
