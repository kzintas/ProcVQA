  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The node \"UMD Offense\" is connected to three nodes: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"Foul\" and \"Made Shot\". The link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Missed Shot\" is labeled with the count '14'.\n\n2. **Analyze the pathways**: The diagram shows that after \"UMD Offense\", there are four possible paths: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", and \"Made Shot\". We are interested in the path that leads directly to \"Missed Shot\".\n\n3. **Count the sequences**: The link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 14. This indicates that 14 sequences proceeded from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the diagram, the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense is 14.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>14</answer>",
