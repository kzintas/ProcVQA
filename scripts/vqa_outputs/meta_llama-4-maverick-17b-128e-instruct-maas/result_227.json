  "question": "How many total made shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "37",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram provides counts for \"Made Shot\" across different sequences. By identifying and summing these counts, we can determine the total number of made shots.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes**: The nodes representing \"Made Shot\" are crucial for answering this question. We observe that there are multiple instances of \"Made Shot\" across different pathways in the diagram.\n\n2. **Extract Counts for Made Shots**: \n   - In the first pathway, \"Made Shot\" has a count of 2.\n   - In the second pathway, there is no direct count for \"Made Shot\" associated with the initial sequence, but later it shows \"Made Shot\" with a count of 28.\n   - In the third pathway, \"Made Shot\" has a count of 7.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts**: To find the total number of made shots, we sum the counts associated with \"Made Shot\" across all pathways.\n   - Total Made Shots = 2 (from the first pathway) + 28 (from the second pathway) + 7 (from the third pathway)\n\n4. **Calculate the Total**:\n   - Total Made Shots = 2 + 28 + 7 = 37\n\nTherefore, the total number of made shots by both teams is 37.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram provides counts for \"Made Shot\" across different sequences. By identifying and summing these counts, we can determine the total number of made shots.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>37</answer>",
