  "full_response": "To determine the number of rebounds made after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this visualization are the nodes and links related to \"UMD Offense\" and the subsequent events. Specifically, we need to look at the links emanating from \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Examine Links from UMD Offense**: The node \"UMD Offense\" has two outgoing links. One leads to \"Rebound\" and the other to \"_Exit\".\n\n3. **Count of Rebounds**: The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with a count of 34. This indicates that 34 sequences proceeded from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n\n4. **Thought Process**: The question asks for the number of rebounds made after \"UMD Offense\". Since the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" represents the sequences where a rebound occurred after \"UMD Offense\", the count on this link directly answers the question.\n\n5. **Calculation**: The count on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is 34.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that 34 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". This directly corresponds to the number of rebounds made after \"UMD Offense\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
