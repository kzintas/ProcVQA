  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "4",
  "llm_answer": "4",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram provides a visual representation of the sequences of events. By examining the links emanating from \"UMD Offense,\" we can see that there is a direct link to \"Steal\" with a count of 4. This count represents the number of sequences where a steal occurred after UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant elements.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and branching out into different paths. We are interested in the path that involves \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n2. **Locate \"UMD Offense\"**: In the diagram, \"UMD Offense\" is a node that has several outgoing links to different events.\n\n3. **Examine the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\"**: The outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" lead to \"Foul,\" \"_Exit,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and \"Steal.\" The link to \"Steal\" is labeled with a count of 4.\n\n4. **Determine the number of steals**: Since the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Steal\" is labeled with a count of 4, this indicates that 4 sequences followed this path.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the diagram, the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense is 4.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram provides a visual representation of the sequences of events. By examining the links emanating from \"UMD Offense,\" we can see that there is a direct link to \"Steal\" with a count of 4. This count represents the number of sequences where a steal occurred after UMD Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>4</answer>",
