  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency, we need to examine the link between the \"Emergency\" node and the \"ICU\" node. The width of this link is proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and the numeric label next to the link shows the exact count of sequences. In this case, the label is \"62\", which indicates that 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.",
  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events for patients. The relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer are the nodes labeled \"Emergency\" and \"ICU\" and the link between them.\n\nThe link between \"Emergency\" and \"ICU\" has a numeric label \"62\" next to it, indicating the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency.\n\n<reasoning>\nTo determine the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency, we need to examine the link between the \"Emergency\" node and the \"ICU\" node.
