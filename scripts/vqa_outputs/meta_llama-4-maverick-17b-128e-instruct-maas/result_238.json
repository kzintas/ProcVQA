  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows a sequence where \"UNC Offense\" is directly followed by \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1 associated with \"Jump Ball\". This indicates that there is one occurrence of \"Jump Ball\" after \"UNC Offense\".",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of times a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram carefully.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing events and directed links indicating the flow of these events. We are interested in the sequence where \"UNC Offense\" is followed by \"Jump Ball\".\n\n2. **Examine the Diagram**: Looking at the provided diagram, there are multiple sequences starting with \"_Start\" and \"UNC Offense\". We need to find a link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\".\n\n3. **Locate the Sequence**: Upon closer inspection, we find that in the first sequence on the left, \"UNC Offense\" is followed by \"Jump Ball\". The count associated with \"Jump Ball\" is 1.\n\n4. **Analyze the Link**: The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Jump Ball\" is present, and the count next to \"Jump Ball\" indicates that it happened once.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there is only one instance where \"Jump Ball\" follows \"UNC Offense\", as indicated by the count of 1 next to \"Jump Ball\", we can conclude that a jump ball occurred once after UNC Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a sequence where \"UNC Offense\" is directly followed by \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1 associated with \"Jump Ball\". This indicates that there is one occurrence of \"Jump Ball\" after \"UNC Offense\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
