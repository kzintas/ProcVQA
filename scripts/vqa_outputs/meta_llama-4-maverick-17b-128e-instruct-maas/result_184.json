  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The count of made shots between UNC Offense and UMD Offense is determined by examining the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", which has a count of 22.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant nodes in this context are \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\". The links between these nodes and their corresponding counts are crucial.\n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: The diagram shows that from \"UNC Offense\", there are two possible paths: one leading to \"Rebound\" with a count of 15, and another leading to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 23. From \"Made Shot\", there is a path to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 22.\n\n3. **Calculate Made Shots**: Since we are interested in the number of made shots after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\", we look at the count associated with the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" and then from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". The count from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" is 23, and from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 22.\n\n4. **Reasoning**: The number of made shots after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\" is directly given by the count on the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", which is 22. This indicates that 22 sequences involved a made shot between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is 22.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe count of made shots between UNC Offense and UMD Offense is determined by examining the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", which has a count of 22.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>22</answer>",
