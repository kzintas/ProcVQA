  "question": "How many total made shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "29",
  "llm_answer": "29",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows several sequences of events related to basketball game plays. To find the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to identify the \"Made Shot\" nodes and sum their counts. The relevant counts are 2, 7, 3, and 17, which correspond to the \"Made Shot\" events in different sequences. By adding these counts together, we get the total number of made shots.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant nodes and their corresponding counts.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes**: The nodes representing \"Made Shot\" are the focus, as they indicate the successful shots made by either team.\n\n2. **Count Made Shots for Each Team**: \n   - For the sequences starting with \"UNC Offense,\" we observe \"Made Shot\" nodes with counts associated with them. Specifically, one sequence has a \"Made Shot\" count of 2, and another has a count of 7.\n   - For sequences involving \"UMD Offense,\" there are \"Made Shot\" nodes with counts of 3, 17.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts**: To find the total number of made shots, we sum the counts associated with all \"Made Shot\" nodes across the different sequences.\n   - The counts are 2, 7, 3, and 17.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Made Shots**: \n   - Total Made Shots = 2 + 7 + 3 + 17 = 29\n\n## Step-by-Step Analysis in XML Tag\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows several sequences of events related to basketball game plays.
