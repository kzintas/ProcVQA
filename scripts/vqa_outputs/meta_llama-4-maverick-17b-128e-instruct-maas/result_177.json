  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of made shots that occurred after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The nodes relevant to our question are \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\". We need to examine the links between these nodes to understand the sequence of events.\n\n2. **Examine the Sequence of Events**: The diagram shows that after \"UNC Offense\", there are two possible paths: one leading to \"Rebound\" and the other to \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\". The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a count of 23, and the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 22.\n\n3. **Count Made Shots Before UMD Offense**: To have a \"Made Shot\" before \"UMD Offense\", we look at the path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\". The count associated with this link is 23. This indicates that 23 sequences involved a \"Made Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\". We also observe that \"Made Shot\" is followed by \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 22, indicating that 22 out of the 23 \"Made Shot\" events were followed by \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since 22 \"Made Shot\" events were followed by \"UMD Offense\", it means that these 22 made shots occurred after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\".\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>22</answer>",
