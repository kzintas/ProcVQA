  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram does not contain any information about \"free throws.\" The events and outcomes shown are related to offenses, rebounds, missed shots, and made shots but do not include free throws.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of free throws made in total by UMD Offense, we need to carefully examine the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events related to offenses and outcomes like rebounds, missed shots, and made shots. We need to identify if there's any direct or indirect reference to \"free throws.\"\n\n2. **Examine Nodes and Links**: The nodes represent events such as \"UNC Offense,\" \"UMD Offense,\" \"Rebound,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and \"Made Shot.\" The links between these nodes are labeled with numbers indicating the count of sequences following that path.\n\n3. **Analyze Pathways**: Starting from \"_Start\" and moving down, we see that all 69 sequences go through \"UNC Offense\" and then \"UMD Offense.\" After \"UMD Offense,\" the sequences diverge into three paths: \"Rebound\" (34 sequences), \"Missed Shot\" (14 sequences), and another path directly to \"_Exit\" (21 sequences).\n\n4. **Look for \"Free Throw\" Information**: Upon examining the diagram, there is no explicit mention or indication of \"free throws\" in any of the nodes or links.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there is no information or reference to \"free throws\" in the provided node-link diagram, we cannot determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense based on the given visualization.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram does not contain any information about \"free throws.\" The events and outcomes shown are related to offenses, rebounds, missed shots, and made shots but do not include free throws.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
