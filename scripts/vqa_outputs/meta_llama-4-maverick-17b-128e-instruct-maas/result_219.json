  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game between UNC and UMD. We are looking for \"Rebound\" events.\n\n2. **Locate Rebound Events**: Upon examining the diagram, we find two instances where \"Rebound\" is mentioned:\n   - One instance is associated with the count '26'.\n   - Another instance is associated with the count '17'.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Rebounds**: To find the total number of rebounds, we add the counts associated with the \"Rebound\" events.\n   - Total Rebounds = 26 + 17 = 43\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the node-link diagram, we have determined that the total number of rebounds made by both teams is 43.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>43</answer>",
