  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of missed shots before UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the pathways that lead to UMD Offense.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and progressing through various nodes representing different events in a basketball game. The relevant elements for our question are the nodes \"UNC Offense,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n2. **Analyze Pathways to UMD Offense**: The node \"UNC Offense\" is followed by three possible events: \"Made Shot,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and \"Foul.\" We need to track the pathways from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" and count the number of \"Missed Shot\" events.\n\n3. **Count Missed Shots Before UMD Offense**: \n   - From \"UNC Offense,\" there are 15 sequences that lead to \"Missed Shot.\"\n   - The \"Missed Shot\" node is directly followed by \"UMD Offense\" with 24 sequences, but we are interested in the count of \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense.\" The count of \"Missed Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" is 15.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there are 15 sequences that result in \"Missed Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense,\" we can conclude that there were 15 missed shots before UMD Offense.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>15</answer>",
