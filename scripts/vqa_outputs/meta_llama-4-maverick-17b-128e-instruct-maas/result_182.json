  "question": "How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The node-link diagram shows event sequences.\n- \"UMD Offense\" is a key node with two outgoing links: one to \"Rebound\" and one to \"_Exit\".\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with 34, indicating 34 sequences.\n- Therefore, 34 rebounds were made after \"UMD Offense\".",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of rebounds made after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this visualization are the nodes and links related to \"UMD Offense\" and the subsequent events. Specifically, we need to look at the links emanating from \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Examine Links from \"UMD Offense\"**: The node \"UMD Offense\" has two outgoing links. One leads to \"Rebound\" and the other to \"_Exit\".\n\n3. **Count of Rebounds After \"UMD Offense\"**: The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with the number 34. This indicates that 34 sequences followed the path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The link from \"Rebound\" to \"_Exit\" is labeled with 15, showing that 15 sequences ended after \"Rebound\".\n\n4. **Analysis**: The question asks for the number of rebounds made after \"UMD Offense\". The count of sequences going from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" directly answers this question.\n\n5. **Calculation**: The count is directly obtained from the link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Rebound\", which is 34.\n\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning\n<reasoning>\n- The node-link diagram shows event sequences.\n- \"UMD Offense\" is a key node with two outgoing links: one to \"Rebound\" and one to \"_Exit\".\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with 34, indicating 34 sequences.\n- Therefore, 34 rebounds were made after \"UMD Offense\".\n</reasoning>\n\n## Final Answer\n<answer>34</answer>",
