  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that from \"UMD Offense\", there is a direct path to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 8. Additionally, there's a path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" and then to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15. To find the total shots made by UMD Offense, we need to sum these counts.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of shots made by UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways and counts.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram starts with \"_Start\" and proceeds through \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". From \"UMD Offense\", there are three main paths: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"Foul\" or \"Made Shot\". We are interested in the paths that lead to \"Made Shot\" as they directly indicate shots made.\n\n2. **Pathways to Made Shot**: There are two pathways to \"Made Shot\":\n   - One directly from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot\".\n   - Another from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n\n3. **Count the Shots Made**:\n   - Directly from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot\": The count is 8.\n   - From \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\": The count is 15.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Shots Made by UMD Offense**: To find the total shots made by UMD Offense, we sum the counts from the two relevant pathways.\n   - Total = 8 (direct \"Made Shot\") + 15 (via \"Rebound\") = 23\n\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that from \"UMD Offense\", there is a direct path to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 8. Additionally, there's a path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" and then to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15. To find the total shots made by UMD Offense, we need to sum these counts.\n</reasoning>\n\n## Final Answer:\n<answer>23</answer>",
