  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and proceeding through various nodes. To find the number of missed shots before \"UMD Offense\", we examine the links and counts between relevant nodes. The count from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 24, indicating that 24 sequences represent missed shots before \"UMD Offense\".",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of missed shots before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes and links between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". Specifically, we need to look at the paths from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\", and then from these nodes to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: \n   - The diagram shows that from \"UNC Offense\", there are two possible paths: to \"Made Shot\" and to \"Rebound\". \n   - The path to \"Rebound\" has a count of 15, and then from \"Rebound\" to \"Missed Shot\" is not directly connected; instead, \"Rebound\" is a separate node. The correct sequence is \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" (23 sequences) and \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" (15 sequences), then \"Rebound\" to \"Missed Shot\" (15 sequences).\n   - The total count for \"Missed Shot\" is 15 (from \"Rebound\") + 0 (since there's no direct link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" without going through \"Rebound\") = 15. However, we should directly observe the count associated with \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", which is 24.\n\n3. **Calculate Missed Shots Before UMD Offense**:\n   - The count associated with \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 24. This indicates that 24 sequences went from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the count directly associated with \"Missed Shot\" is linked to \"UMD Offense\" with a value of 24, this means there were 24 missed shots before UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and proceeding through various nodes. To find the number of missed shots before \"UMD Offense\", we examine the links and counts between relevant nodes. The count from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is 24, indicating that 24 sequences represent missed shots before \"UMD Offense\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
