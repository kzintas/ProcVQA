  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram illustrates that 24 sequences went from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". Thus, the number of missed shots before UMD Offense is 24.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of missed shots before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\". The links between these nodes and their corresponding counts are also crucial.\n\n2. **Understand the Flow**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and progressing through various states until it reaches \"_Exit\". The flow relevant to our question is from \"UNC Offense\" to either \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\", and then to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Pathways**:\n   - From \"UNC Offense\", there are two possible paths: to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 22, and to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 24.\n   - Both \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\" lead to \"UMD Offense\", with counts of 22 and 24, respectively.\n\n4. **Calculate Missed Shots Before UMD Offense**: To find the number of missed shots before \"UMD Offense\", we look at the count associated with the link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", which is 24.\n\n5. **Reasoning**: The count of 24 directly represents the number of sequences where \"Missed Shot\" occurred before \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, the number of missed shots before UMD Offense is directly given by the count on the link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram illustrates that 24 sequences went from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". Thus, the number of missed shots before UMD Offense is 24.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
