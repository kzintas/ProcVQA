  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that 69 sequences reached \"UMD Offense\". Out of these, 34 transitioned to \"Rebound\" and 35 went directly to \"_Exit\". Thus, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to examine the node-link diagram and analyze the transitions from UMD Offense.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this visualization are the nodes labeled \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\", along with the links connecting them. The link widths and numeric labels next to them indicate the number of sequences following each path.\n\n2. **Analyze Transitions from UMD Offense**: Looking at the diagram, we see that \"UMD Offense\" has two outgoing links: one to \"Rebound\" and one directly to \"_Exit\". The link to \"Rebound\" is labeled with '34', indicating that 34 sequences transitioned from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The link directly to \"_Exit\" is labeled with '35', indicating that 35 sequences transitioned from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" without going through \"Rebound\".\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Times UMD Offense Did Not Transition to Rebound**: To find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we look at the count of sequences that went directly from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\", which is 35.\n\n4. **Reasoning**: The total number of sequences that reached \"UMD Offense\" is 69, as indicated by the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". Out of these, 34 sequences transitioned to \"Rebound\", and 35 sequences went directly to \"_Exit\". Therefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is the count of sequences that went directly to \"_Exit\", which is 35.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that 69 sequences reached \"UMD Offense\". Out of these, 34 transitioned to \"Rebound\" and 35 went directly to \"_Exit\". Thus, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
