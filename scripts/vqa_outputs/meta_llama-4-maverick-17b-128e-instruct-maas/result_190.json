  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "46",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The total number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense is calculated by summing the counts of the two paths leading from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\", which are through \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\". The count through \"Made Shot\" is 22, and through \"Missed Shot\" is 24. Thus, the total count is 22 + 24 = 46.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram closely.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this visualization are the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" and the links connecting them or leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Understand the Diagram**: The diagram shows sequences of events with directed links indicating the flow from one event to another. The width of the links and the numeric labels next to them represent the count of sequences following that path.\n\n3. **Analyze the Links**: \n   - The node \"UNC Offense\" has two outgoing links, one leading to \"Made Shot\" and the other to \"Missed Shot\". \n   - The counts for these links are 22 and 24, respectively.\n\n4. **Transition to UMD Offense**: \n   - \"Made Shot\" has a link to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 22.\n   - \"Missed Shot\" also has a link to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 24.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Transitions to UMD Offense from UNC Offense**: To find the total number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to sum the counts of sequences that went from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". This involves adding the counts of the paths \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\" and \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Missed Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\".\n\n6. **Perform Calculation**:\n   - Count via \"Made Shot\": 22\n   - Count via \"Missed Shot\": 24\n   - Total Count = 22 + 24 = 46\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense is calculated by summing the counts of the two paths leading from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\", which are through \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".
