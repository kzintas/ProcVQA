  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows different pathways representing patient sequences through various hospital stages. We are interested in the \"Discharge-Alive\" node as it directly relates to our question.\n\n2. **Locate \"Discharge-Alive\" Nodes**: Upon examining the diagram, we find that there are two instances where \"Discharge-Alive\" is mentioned: one associated with 37 patients and another with 20 patients.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Patients Discharged Alive**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we simply add the counts associated with each \"Discharge-Alive\" event. total_discharged_alive = 37 + 20 = 57\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the diagram and summing the counts for \"Discharge-Alive\" events, we can accurately determine the total number of patients discharged alive.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>57</answer>",
