  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing different events and links indicating the flow between these events. We are interested in the \"Rebound\" events.\n\n2. **Locate Rebound Events**: Upon examining the diagram, we find two instances where \"Rebound\" is mentioned:\n   - In the second column, \"Rebound\" occurs 19 times.\n   - In the fourth column, \"Rebound\" occurs 15 times.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Rebounds**: To find the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we add the counts from both instances.\n   - Total Rebounds = Rebounds in Column 2 + Rebounds in Column 4\n   - Total Rebounds = 19 + 15\n\n4. **Perform Calculation**: \n   - Total Rebounds = 34\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The total number of rebounds made by both teams is 34.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>34</answer>",
