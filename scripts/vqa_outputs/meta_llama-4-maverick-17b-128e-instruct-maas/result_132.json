  "question": "How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "14",
  "llm_answer": "14",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that 14 sequences resulted in a \"Missed Shot\" immediately after \"UMD Offense\". This is derived from the count on the link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Missed Shot\".",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant elements.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The node \"UMD Offense\" is connected to three subsequent nodes: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\". The links between these nodes have numeric labels indicating the count of sequences.\n\n2. **Analyze the links from \"UMD Offense\"**: The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 14, and the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" (directly) has a count of 21. However, the question specifically asks for shots missed immediately after UMD Offense.\n\n3. **Determine the number of shots missed**: The node \"Missed Shot\" directly follows \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 14. This indicates that 14 sequences resulted in a \"Missed Shot\" immediately after \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4. **Consider other paths**: The other path related to a shot is through \"Rebound\" and then \"Made Shot\". However, this is not \"immediately after UMD Offense\" as it involves an intermediate step (\"Rebound\").\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the diagram, the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense is directly given by the count on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that 14 sequences resulted in a \"Missed Shot\" immediately after \"UMD Offense\". This is derived from the count on the link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>14</answer>",
