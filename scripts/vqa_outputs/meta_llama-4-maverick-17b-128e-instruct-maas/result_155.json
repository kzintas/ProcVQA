  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that after \"UMD Offense\", there are two possible paths: to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 and to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35. The total count after \"UMD Offense\" is 69 (34 + 35). Thus, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is equal to the count of the path that goes directly to \"_Exit\", which is 35.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes and links between \"UMD Offense\" and its subsequent events. Specifically, we are interested in the links from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" and to \"_Exit\".\n\n2. **Analyze the Links**: \n   - The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with a count of 34.\n   - The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" (directly) is labeled with a count of 35.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Times UMD Offense Did Not Transition to a Rebound**:\n   - The total number of sequences that proceeded from \"UMD Offense\" is 34 (to \"Rebound\") + 35 (to \"_Exit\") = 69.\n   - The number of times UMD Offense transitioned to a Rebound is 34.\n   - Therefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is the count of sequences that went directly to \"_Exit\", which is 35.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the diagram, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that after \"UMD Offense\", there are two possible paths: to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 and to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35. The total count after \"UMD Offense\" is 69 (34 + 35). Thus, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is equal to the count of the path that goes directly to \"_Exit\", which is 35.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
