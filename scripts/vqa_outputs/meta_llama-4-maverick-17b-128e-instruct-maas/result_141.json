  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and progressing through various stages until \"_Exit\". Focusing on the path from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", we observe that 15 sequences transition from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\". This directly answers the question regarding the number of shots made after a Rebound.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to examine the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes and links that represent the sequence of events related to \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\". Specifically, we need to look at the link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\".\n\n2. **Analyze the Link**: The diagram shows that after \"Rebound\", there are two possible paths: one leading to \"Made Shot\" and another to \"_Exit\". The link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" is labeled with the number 15.\n\n3. **Interpret the Data**: The number 15 on the link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" indicates that 15 sequences followed this path. This means that 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the node-link diagram, we can conclude that 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and progressing through various stages until \"_Exit\". Focusing on the path from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", we observe that 15 sequences transition from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".
