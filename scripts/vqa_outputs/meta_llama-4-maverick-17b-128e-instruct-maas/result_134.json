  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that 15 sequences resulted in a \"Made Shot\" after \"Rebound\". This directly corresponds to the number of shots made by UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of shots made by UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes and links related to \"UMD Offense\" and its subsequent events.\n\n2. **Analyze the Diagram**:\n   - The diagram starts with \"_Start\" and flows through \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n   - \"UMD Offense\" has three outgoing paths: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n   - The path \"Rebound\" further branches into \"Made Shot\" and \"_Exit\".\n\n3. **Calculate Shots Made**:\n   - The total number of sequences that reached \"UMD Offense\" is 69.\n   - Out of these, 34 sequences led to \"Rebound\", 14 to \"Missed Shot\", and 21 to \"_Exit\".\n   - From \"Rebound\", 15 sequences resulted in \"Made Shot\", and 19 in \"_Exit\".\n   - Therefore, the number of shots made can be directly inferred from the \"Made Shot\" node.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - The number of shots made by UMD Offense is directly related to the \"Made Shot\" event.\n   - Since \"Made Shot\" is a subsequent event of \"Rebound\", we look at the count associated with \"Made Shot\".\n   - The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with 15, indicating that 15 sequences resulted in a made shot.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total number of shots made by UMD Offense is equal to the count associated with \"Made Shot\", which is 15.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that 15 sequences resulted in a \"Made Shot\" after \"Rebound\". This directly corresponds to the number of shots made by UMD Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
