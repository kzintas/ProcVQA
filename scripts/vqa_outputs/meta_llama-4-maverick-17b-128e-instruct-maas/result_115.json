  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "20",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To find the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we subtract the number of sequences that transitioned to \"Rebound\" from the total number of sequences out of \"UMD Offense\". The total sequences out of \"UMD Offense\" are given as 34, and the sequences to \"Rebound\" are 14. Thus, the calculation is 34 - 14 = 20.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this visualization are the nodes and links related to \"UMD Offense\" and its subsequent transitions.\n\n2. **Analyze the Diagram**: \n   - The node \"UMD Offense\" has 34 sequences transitioning out of it.\n   - The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of 14 sequences.\n   - Other links from \"UMD Offense\" are to \"Missed Shot\" (10 sequences), \"Foul\" (8 sequences), and \"Made Shot\" (3 sequences, though not directly linked in the description, it is visible in the OCR data and diagram).\n\n3. **Calculate Sequences Not Transitioning to Rebound**:\n   - Total sequences out of \"UMD Offense\" = 34\n   - Sequences transitioning to \"Rebound\" = 14\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   <reasoning>\n   To find the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we subtract the number of sequences that transitioned to \"Rebound\" from the total number of sequences out of \"UMD Offense\".
