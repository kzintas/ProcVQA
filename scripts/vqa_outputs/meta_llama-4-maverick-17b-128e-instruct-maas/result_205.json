  "question": "How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "33",
  "llm_answer": "33",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the nodes and links related to rebounds.\n\n1. **Identify Rebound Nodes**: The diagram contains multiple instances of \"Rebound\" nodes. We need to count the number associated with each \"Rebound\" node.\n\n2. **Count Rebounds**: \n   - In the second pathway, \"Rebound\" has a count of 14.\n   - In the same pathway, another \"Rebound\" appears with a count of 7.\n   - In the third pathway, \"Rebound\" has a count of 1.\n   - In the fourth pathway, there is no \"Rebound\" node.\n   - In the fifth pathway, there is no \"Rebound\" node directly counted, but we see a \"Rebound\" with a count of 11 in the first pathway.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts**: To find the total number of rebounds, we sum the counts associated with all \"Rebound\" nodes.\n   - Total Rebounds = 14 (from the second pathway) + 7 (from the second pathway) + 1 (from the third pathway) + 11 (from the first pathway) = 33\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: We have considered all \"Rebound\" nodes visible in the pathways and summed their counts.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The total number of rebounds made by both teams is the sum of the counts associated with the \"Rebound\" nodes.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>33</answer>",
