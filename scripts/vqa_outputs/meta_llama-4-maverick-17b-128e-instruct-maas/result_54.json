  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways and counts.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows several nodes representing different stages in a patient's journey, such as \"_Start\", \"Arrival\", \"Emergency\", \"Floor\", \"ICU\", \"Discharge-Alive\", and \"_Exit\". We are interested in the \"Discharge-Alive\" node(s) as they directly relate to our question.\n\n2. **Count Patients Discharged Alive**: There are two instances where patients are \"Discharge-Alive\". The first is directly after \"Emergency\" with 38 patients, and the second is after being on the \"Floor\" (following \"ICU\") with 24 patients.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Patients Discharged Alive**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts from both \"Discharge-Alive\" instances.\n   - First instance: 38 patients\n   - Second instance: 24 patients\n   \n   Total = 38 + 24 = 62\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the diagram and summing the counts associated with \"Discharge-Alive\", we can determine the total number of patients discharged alive.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>62</answer>",
