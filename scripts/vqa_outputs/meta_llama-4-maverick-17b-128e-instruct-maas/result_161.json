  "question": "How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "6",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of rebounds made after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram carefully.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: We are looking for the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" and any subsequent nodes that represent \"Rebound\".\n   \n2. **Locate \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram**: The node \"UMD Offense\" is found in the middle-right part of the diagram.\n\n3. **Trace the pathways following \"UMD Offense\"**: After \"UMD Offense\", there are three main paths: one leading to \"Missed Shot\", one to \"Foul\", and none directly to \"Rebound\". However, we need to check if any of these paths or subsequent paths lead to \"Rebound\".\n\n4. **Check for \"Rebound\" after \"UMD Offense\"**: \n   - The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" does not directly lead to \"Rebound\" in the next step but continues to \"_Exit\".\n   - The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" leads to \"Made Free Throw\" and then to \"_Exit\", not to \"Rebound\".\n   - However, upon closer inspection, we see that there is a \"Rebound\" node that appears after \"Missed Shot\" (which is a possible next event after \"UNC Offense\") and also directly after \"Foul\" is not a direct path but \"Rebound\" is seen after \"Missed Shot\" under \"UNC Offense\".\n\n5. **Count the rebounds after \"UMD Offense\"**: There is one \"Rebound\" node directly after a sequence that starts with \"Foul\" under \"UNC Offense\" is not relevant. However, we find a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 4 under the path starting from \"Foul\" under \"UMD Offense\" is not directly connected but there is a \"Rebound\" with a count associated with it.\n\n6. **Direct count**: Upon examining the diagram, we find that there is a \"Rebound\" with a count of 4 directly under the events following \"UNC Offense\" and another \"Rebound\" is not directly after \"UMD Offense\". However, there is a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 6 under a different branch.\n\n7. **Relevant count**: The relevant \"Rebound\" count after \"UMD Offense\" is not directly available; however, we see a \"Rebound\" with a count of 6.\n\n## Step-by-step analysis:\n- The diagram shows that after \"UMD Offense\", there isn't a direct \"Rebound\".\n- We identify a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 6.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe number of rebounds made after UMD Offense is not directly determinable from the given paths. However, there is a \"Rebound\" with a count of 6.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>6</answer>",
