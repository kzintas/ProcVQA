  "question": "How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The total number of shots made by UNC Offense is calculated by adding the counts from the relevant pathways. From the first column, we have 2 \"Made Shot\" events, and from the fourth column, we have 20 \"Made Shot\" events. Thus, the total is 2 + 20 = 22.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways and counts.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Pathways**: We are looking for sequences that start with \"UNC Offense\" and end with \"Made Shot.\" The diagram shows multiple pathways, but we are interested in those that involve \"UNC Offense\" leading to \"Made Shot.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Diagram**: The diagram is divided into several columns representing different sequences of events. We need to look for columns that start with \"UNC Offense\" and check if they lead to \"Made Shot.\"\n\n3. **Count the Shots Made by UNC Offense**: \n   - In the first column, \"UNC Offense\" is followed by \"Jump Ball\" and then \"Missed Shot\" or \"Made Shot.\" The count for \"Made Shot\" here is 2.\n   - In the second column, \"UNC Offense\" is followed by \"Rebound\" and then \"Missed Shot.\" There's no direct \"Made Shot\" from \"UNC Offense\" here.\n   - In the third column, \"UNC Offense\" is followed by \"Foul\" and then \"Made Free Throw.\" While this involves scoring, it's not a shot made directly by \"UNC Offense\" in the context of field goals.\n   - In the fourth column, \"UNC Offense\" directly leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 20.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total**: We identified two relevant counts for \"Made Shot\" directly associated with \"UNC Offense\": 2 (from the first column) and 20 (from the fourth column). \n\n5. **Conclusion**: To find the total number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we sum the counts from the relevant pathways.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of shots made by UNC Offense is calculated by adding the counts from the relevant pathways. From the first column, we have 2 \"Made Shot\" events, and from the fourth column, we have 20 \"Made Shot\" events. Thus, the total is 2 + 20 = 22.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>22</answer>",
