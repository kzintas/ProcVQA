  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>\n- The diagram shows that after \"Rebound\", there are two possible next events: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n- The count of sequences for \"Made Shot\" after \"Rebound\" is directly obtained from the link between these two nodes.\n- The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with 15, indicating that 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to examine the node-link diagram and follow the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and progressing through various nodes representing different events in a basketball game. We are interested in the pathway that involves \"Rebound\" and the subsequent events.\n\n2. **Track the pathway**: The node \"Rebound\" is connected to two nodes: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\". The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a label indicating 15 sequences, and the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a label indicating 9 sequences.\n\n3. **Analyze the relevant pathway**: We are specifically interested in the number of shots made directly after a \"Rebound\". This corresponds to the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", which is labeled with the count of sequences.\n\n4. **Determine the count**: The count of sequences from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 15.\n\n## Step-by-step reasoning in XML tag <reasoning>\n<reasoning>\n- The diagram shows that after \"Rebound\", there are two possible next events: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n- The count of sequences for \"Made Shot\" after \"Rebound\" is directly obtained from the link between these two nodes.\n- The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with 15, indicating that 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n</reasoning>\n\n## Final answer in the required format\n<answer>15</answer>",
