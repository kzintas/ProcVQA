  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the nodes labeled \"Rebound.\"\n\nThe diagram shows five separate sequences or pathways, each representing a different sequence of events. We will examine each pathway to count the number of rebounds.\n\n1. The first pathway starts with \"_Start\" (7) and \"UNC Offense\" (7), followed by \"Missed Shot\" (7), \"UMD Offense\" (7), \"Rebound\" (7), \"Missed Shot\" (6), \"Rebound\" (11), and ends with \"Made Shot\" (7) and \"_Exit\" (7). The total number of rebounds in this pathway is 7 + 11 = 18.\n\n2. The second pathway starts with \"_Start\" (14) and \"UNC Offense\" (14), followed by \"Rebound\" (14) and \"Missed Shot\" (14). It then proceeds to \"Made Free Throw\" (13) and \"UMD Offense\" (13), followed by \"Made Free Throw\" (8) and \"UMD Offense\" (8). The total number of rebounds in this pathway is 14.\n\n3. The third pathway starts with \"_Start\" (15) and \"UNC Offense\" (15), followed by \"Foul\" (15) and \"Made Free Throw\" (13), ending with \"_Exit\" (15). There are no rebounds in this pathway.\n\n4. The fourth pathway starts with \"_Start\" (5) and \"UNC Offense\" (5), followed by \"Jump Ball\" (1) and \"UMD Offense\" (5), then \"Made Shot\" (4) and \"_Exit\" (5). Another sequence starts with \"Rebound\" (18), followed by \"Made Shot\" (16), \"UMD Offense\" (12), and \"Missed Shot\" (7), ending with \"_Exit\" (28). The total number of rebounds in this pathway is 18.\n\n5. The fifth pathway is not explicitly detailed but is represented in the overall count.\n\nTo find the total number of rebounds, we sum the counts from each relevant node: 7 + 11 + 14 + 18 = 50.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe relevant elements in the visualization that inform our answer are the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and their corresponding counts. We identified these nodes in each pathway and summed their counts to determine the total number of rebounds.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>50</answer>",
