  "question": "How many Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram clearly shows that 34 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". Therefore, the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense is 34.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`. The events are connected by directed links, and the width of these links is proportional to the number of sequences following that path. The numeric labels next to the links indicate the exact count of sequences.\n\n2. **Locate UMD Offense**: We locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram. It is positioned below \"UNC Offense\" and has two outgoing links: one leading to \"Rebound\" and another directly to `_Exit`.\n\n3. **Count Rebounds**: The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with the number 34. This indicates that 34 sequences followed the path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the question asks for the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense, we can directly infer this from the count associated with the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram clearly shows that 34 sequences went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". Therefore, the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense is 34.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
