  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. We start by identifying the \"Rebound\" node in the diagram.\n2. We then examine the outgoing links from \"Rebound\" to determine the subsequent events.\n3. Among these links, we find that 15 sequences lead to \"Made Shot\" directly after \"Rebound\".\n4. Therefore, the number of shots made directly after a Rebound is the count associated with the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", which is 15.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to examine the node-link diagram and follow the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and ending at various \"_Exit\" points. We are interested in the pathway that involves \"Rebound\" and the subsequent events.\n\n2. **Locate \"Rebound\" in the diagram**: The node \"Rebound\" is found below \"UMD Offense\". It has three outgoing links to \"Made Shot\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"Foul\".\n\n3. **Analyze the links from \"Rebound\"**: \n   - The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a count of 15.\n   - The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 9.\n   - The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Foul\" has a count of 6.\n\n4. **Determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound**: We are specifically interested in the count of \"Made Shot\" directly following \"Rebound\", which is 15.\n\n## Step-by-step reasoning\n<reasoning>\n1.
