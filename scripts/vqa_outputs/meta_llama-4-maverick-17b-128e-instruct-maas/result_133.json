  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that after \"Rebound,\" 15 sequences lead to \"Made Shot.\" This indicates that 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to examine the node-link diagram and follow the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and progressing through various stages. We are interested in the pathway that involves \"Rebound\" and the subsequent event.\n\n2. **Track the pathway**: The diagram indicates that after \"UMD Offense,\" there are three possible paths: \"Rebound,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and \"_Exit.\" We focus on the \"Rebound\" path, which has 34 sequences.\n\n3. **Analyze the \"Rebound\" node**: After \"Rebound,\" there are two possible paths: \"Made Shot\" and \"_Exit.\" The link to \"Made Shot\" has a count of 15, and the link to \"_Exit\" has a count of 19.\n\n4. **Determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound**: The count on the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" directly answers our question. This count is 15.\n\nTherefore, the number of shots made directly after a Rebound is 15.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that after \"Rebound,\" 15 sequences lead to \"Made Shot.\" This indicates that 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
