  "full_response": "To determine the number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" and the link between them.\n   \n2. **Examine the Link**: The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" represents the transition from one to the other. The number next to this link indicates how many times this transition occurred.\n\n3. **Read the Count**: According to the diagram, there are 69 sequences that start with \"_Start\" and move to \"UNC Offense\". All 69 of these sequences then transition to \"UMD Offense\", as indicated by the count '69' on the link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since all 69 sequences that reached \"UNC Offense\" then moved to \"UMD Offense\", the number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense is 69.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a clear pathway from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 69, indicating that UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
