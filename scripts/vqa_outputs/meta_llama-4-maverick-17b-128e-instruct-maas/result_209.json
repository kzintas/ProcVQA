  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways and counts.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Pathways**: The diagram shows several sequences of events starting with \"UNC Offense.\" We need to track these sequences to see where they lead, particularly focusing on those that result in a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n2. **Examine Counts for Made Shots**: We look for the \"Made Shot\" node and trace back the pathways to \"UNC Offense\" to count how many sequences end in a made shot directly attributed to UNC Offense.\n\n3. **Pathway Analysis**:\n   - The first pathway starts with \"_Start\" (7) -> \"UNC Offense\" (7) -> \"Missed Shot\" (7) -> \"UMD Offense\" (7) -> \"Rebound\" (7) -> \"Missed Shot\" (6) -> \"Rebound\" (6 is not directly shown but implied as 11 after UMD Offense) -> \"Made Shot\" (7). Here, 7 made shots are associated with UNC Offense indirectly.\n   - The second pathway: \"_Start\" (4) -> \"UNC Offense\" (4) -> \"Rebound\" (1) -> \"Turnover\" (2) -> \"Steal\" (2) -> \"_Exit\" (4). This pathway does not directly result in a made shot.\n   - The third pathway: \"_Start\" (4) -> \"UNC Offense\" (4) -> \"Jump Ball\" (1) -> \"Foul\" (3) -> \"_Exit\" (4). This also does not directly result in a made shot.\n   - The fourth pathway: \"_Start\" (15) -> \"UNC Offense\" (15) -> \"Foul\" (15) -> \"Made Free Throw\" (13) -> \"_Exit\" (15). Here, 13 free throws were made.\n   - The fifth pathway: \"_Start\" (25) -> \"UNC Offense\" (25) -> \"Made Shot\" (21) -> \"UMD Offense\" (23) -> \"Missed Shot\" (15) -> \"_Exit\" (25). This shows 21 made shots directly attributed to UNC Offense.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Made Shots by UNC Offense**: From the pathways, we see that 21 made shots are directly attributed to UNC Offense.\n\n**Reasoning**: We analyzed the pathways in the node-link diagram and identified that 21 made shots are directly associated with UNC Offense.\n\n<answer>21</answer>",
