  "question": "How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "40",
  "llm_answer": "40",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows several pathways with \"Rebound\" nodes. By identifying and summing the counts of these nodes, we can calculate the total number of rebounds made by both teams.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the nodes representing rebounds.\n\nThe relevant elements in the visualization are the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and their corresponding counts.\n\n1. **Identify Rebound Nodes**: We observe that there are multiple instances of \"Rebound\" nodes across different pathways in the diagram.\n   \n2. **Count Rebounds**: \n   - In the second pathway from the left, \"Rebound\" occurs with a count of 14.\n   - In the third pathway, \"Rebound\" occurs with a count of 5.\n   - In the same pathway, another \"Rebound\" occurs below \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 8.\n   - In the second pathway from the left, \"Rebound\" occurs again with a count of 13.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Rebounds**: To find the total number of rebounds, we sum the counts associated with all \"Rebound\" nodes.\n   - Total Rebounds = 14 (from the second pathway) + 5 (from the third pathway) + 8 (from the fourth pathway) + 13 (from the second pathway) = 40\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows several pathways with \"Rebound\" nodes. By identifying and summing the counts of these nodes, we can calculate the total number of rebounds made by both teams.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>40</answer>",
