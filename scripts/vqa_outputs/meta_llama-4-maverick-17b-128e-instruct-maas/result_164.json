  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of missed shots before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and leading to various outcomes. We are interested in the path that leads to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n2. **Track Pathways**: The diagram indicates that after \"UNC Offense,\" there are three possible paths: \"Rebound,\" \"Foul,\" and \"Made Shot.\" We need to follow these paths to see which ones lead to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Paths Leading to UMD Offense**:\n   - The path \"Rebound\" -> \"Missed Shot\" is one sequence. The count associated with \"Missed Shot\" is 9.\n   - Another path is \"Foul\" -> \"Made Free Throw\" (twice), and then it can lead to \"Turnover\" or continue to other events. However, we are focused on the count before \"UMD Offense.\"\n   - The direct path to \"UMD Offense\" is not through \"Missed Shot\" directly from \"UNC Offense\" but we see that \"Missed Shot\" occurs before \"UMD Offense\" in one of the sequences.\n\n4. **Count Missed Shots Before UMD Offense**: Looking at the diagram, we see that there are two instances where \"Missed Shot\" occurs before \"UMD Offense\": \n   - One is directly after \"Rebound\" with a count of 9.\n   - Another \"Missed Shot\" is seen after \"Rebound\" (lower in the diagram) with a count of 6.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Missed Shots**: To find the total number of missed shots before \"UMD Offense,\" we sum the counts from the relevant \"Missed Shot\" nodes. So, 9 + 6 = 15.\n\n**Reasoning**: We identified the relevant pathways and counted the \"Missed Shot\" events preceding \"UMD Offense.\" The counts associated with these events were summed to obtain the total.\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
