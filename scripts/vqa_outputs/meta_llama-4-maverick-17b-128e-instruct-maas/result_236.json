  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "3",
  "llm_answer": "14",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is calculated by adding the counts from the two relevant paths: 11 + 3 = 14.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing events and directed links indicating the flow of these events. We are interested in the \"Made Free Throw\" events associated with \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Examine the Diagram**: Looking at the diagram, there are two instances where \"Made Free Throw\" is mentioned:\n   - One instance is directly linked to \"Foul\" with a count of 11.\n   - Another instance is under \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 3.\n\n3. **Analyze the Counts**: The count of 11 is associated with \"Made Free Throw\" following a \"Foul\", and the count of 3 is directly under \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\". Both counts are relevant to understanding the total number of free throws made.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total**: To find the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we add the counts from both instances: 11 (from the path involving \"Foul\") + 3 (directly under \"UMD Offense\").\n\n5. **Reasoning**: \n   - The diagram indicates that there are two paths where \"Made Free Throw\" occurs.\n   - The first path involves a \"Foul\" leading to \"Made Free Throw\" with a count of 11.\n   - The second path is directly under \"UMD Offense\" with \"Made Free Throw\" having a count of 3.\n   - Thus, the total count of free throws made is the sum of these two counts.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is calculated by adding the counts from the two relevant paths: 11 + 3 = 14.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>14</answer>",
