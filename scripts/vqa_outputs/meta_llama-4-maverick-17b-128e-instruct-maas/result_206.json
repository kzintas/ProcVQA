  "full_response": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game between UNC and UMD. We are interested in the \"Made Shot\" events.\n\n2. **Locate \"Made Shot\" Events**: Upon examining the diagram, we find two instances where \"Made Shot\" is mentioned: \n   - One pathway leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 7.\n   - Another pathway leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 21.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Made Shots**: To find the total number of made shots, we add the counts from both pathways.\n   - Total Made Shots = 7 + 21 = 28\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The total number of made shots by both teams is the sum of the counts associated with the \"Made Shot\" events in the diagram.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>28</answer>",
