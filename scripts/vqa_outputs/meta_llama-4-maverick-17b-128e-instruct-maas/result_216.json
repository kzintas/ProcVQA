  "question": "How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?",
  "true_answer": "16",
  "llm_answer": "16",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The relevant elements in the visualization are the sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\" and the count of \"Made Shot\" directly following the events initiated by \"UNC Offense\". By tracking these sequences, we identified that the count of \"Made Shot\" directly after \"Rebound\" (which follows \"UNC Offense\") is 16.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Pathways**: We are looking for sequences that start with \"UNC Offense\" and end with \"Made Shot\". The diagram shows multiple sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\", so we will track these pathways.\n\n2. **Examine Sequences Starting with UNC Offense**:\n   - The first sequence starts with \"_Start 7\" and \"UNC Offense 7\". It proceeds to \"Missed Shot 7\", then \"UMD Offense 7\", followed by \"Rebound 7\", \"Missed Shot 6\", \"Rebound 11\", and finally \"Made Shot 7\". Here, the \"Made Shot\" is after \"UMD Offense\", not directly by \"UNC Offense\".\n   - The second sequence starts with \"_Start 14\" and \"UNC Offense 14\". It goes to \"Rebound 14\", then \"Missed Shot 14\", followed by \"Made Free Throw 13\" (after \"UMD Offense 13\"). The \"Made Free Throw\" is not a \"Made Shot\".\n   - The third sequence starts with \"_Start 15\" and \"UNC Offense 15\". It proceeds to \"Foul 15\" and then \"Made Free Throw 13\" and \"Made Free Throw 8\" (both after \"UMD Offense\"). Again, these are \"Made Free Throw\", not \"Made Shot\".\n   - The fourth sequence starts with \"_Start 5\" and \"UNC Offense 5\". It goes to \"Jump Ball 1\", then \"UMD Offense 5\", followed by \"Made Shot 4\". The \"Made Shot\" is after \"UMD Offense\".\n   - The fifth sequence starts with \"_Start 28\" and \"UNC Offense 28\". It proceeds to \"Rebound 18\" and then \"Made Shot 16\". This \"Made Shot\" is directly after \"Rebound\", which follows \"UNC Offense\".\n\n3. **Count Made Shots by UNC Offense**: From the sequences described, the only direct \"Made Shot\" following a sequence initiated by \"UNC Offense\" is in the fifth sequence where \"Made Shot 16\" occurs.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the pathways examined, the number of shots made directly following \"UNC Offense\" is found in the fifth sequence. The count is 16.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe relevant elements in the visualization are the sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\" and the count of \"Made Shot\" directly following the events initiated by \"UNC Offense\". By tracking these sequences, we identified that the count of \"Made Shot\" directly after \"Rebound\" (which follows \"UNC Offense\") is 16.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>16</answer>",
