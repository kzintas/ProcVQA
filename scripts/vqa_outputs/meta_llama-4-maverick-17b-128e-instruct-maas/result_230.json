  "question": "How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?",
  "true_answer": "28",
  "llm_answer": "28",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events related to basketball offenses by UNC and UMD. We are interested in the \"Made Shot\" events following \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: We need to track the pathways that start with \"UNC Offense\" and end with \"Made Shot\" without transitioning to \"UMD Offense\" in between.\n\n3. **Examine the Diagram**: \n   - The first pathway starts with \"_Start\" (2 sequences), followed by \"UNC Offense\" (2 sequences), then \"Missed Shot\" (2 sequences), and finally \"Made Shot\" (2 sequences) before \"_Exit.\" This pathway involves UNC Offense making shots after a missed shot, but it does not directly tell us about shots made by UNC Offense without a preceding \"Missed Shot\" by them.\n   - The second pathway shows \"_Start\" (19 sequences) leading to \"UNC Offense\" (19 sequences), then \"Missed Shot\" (19 sequences), followed by \"Rebound\" (19 sequences), and then various outcomes. This pathway does not directly lead to a \"Made Shot\" by UNC Offense.\n   - The third pathway starts with \"_Start\" (33 sequences) and \"UNC Offense\" (33 sequences), followed by \"Made Shot\" (28 sequences), and then \"UMD Offense\" (26 sequences). Here, 28 sequences represent shots made by UNC Offense.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Shots Made by UNC Offense**: \n   - From the third pathway, we see that there are 28 \"Made Shot\" events directly following \"UNC Offense.\" This is the count of shots made by UNC Offense.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the diagram, specifically the third pathway, UNC Offense made 28 shots.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>28</answer>",
