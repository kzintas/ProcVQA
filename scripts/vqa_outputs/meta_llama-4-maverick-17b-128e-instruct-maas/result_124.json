  "question": "How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "14",
  "llm_answer": "14",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that there are 14 sequences where \"Missed Shot\" occurs directly after \"UMD Offense\". This is derived from examining the link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Missed Shot\".",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant node**: The node of interest is \"UMD Offense\". This node represents the event after which we are counting the missed shots.\n\n2. **Examine the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\"**: The diagram shows that \"UMD Offense\" has four outgoing links leading to different events: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", and \"Made Shot\".\n\n3. **Identify the link leading to \"Missed Shot\"**: One of the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" directly leads to \"Missed Shot\". The count associated with this link is 14.\n\n4. **Determine the number of missed shots immediately after \"UMD Offense\"**: The count on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" is 14. This indicates that 14 sequences resulted in a \"Missed Shot\" immediately after \"UMD Offense\".\n\nTherefore, the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense is 14.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that there are 14 sequences where \"Missed Shot\" occurs directly after \"UMD Offense\". This is derived from examining the link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>14</answer>",
