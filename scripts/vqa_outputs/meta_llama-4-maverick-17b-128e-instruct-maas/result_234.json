  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram provides a visual representation of the sequences of events in a basketball game. By examining the diagram, we identified the \"Made Shot\" events for both teams and counted their occurrences. We then calculated the total number of made shots for each team and summed them to find the overall total.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant nodes and links.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows various events in a basketball game, including \"Made Shot\" events for both teams. We need to locate these events and count the number of times they occur.\n\n2. **Count Made Shots for Each Team**: \n   - For the UNC team, the \"Made Shot\" event is shown with a count of 2 in the first pathway and 20 in the fifth pathway.\n   - For the UMD team, the \"Made Shot\" event is shown with a count of 8 in the third pathway.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Made Shots**: \n   - Total made shots by UNC = 2 (from the first pathway) + 20 (from the fifth pathway) = 22\n   - Total made shots by UMD = 8 (from the third pathway)\n\n4. **Sum the Made Shots of Both Teams**: \n   - Total made shots = Total made shots by UNC + Total made shots by UMD = 22 + 8 = 30\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram provides a visual representation of the sequences of events in a basketball game.
