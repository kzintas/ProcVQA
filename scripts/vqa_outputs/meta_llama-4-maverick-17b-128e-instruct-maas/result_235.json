  "question": "How many total missed shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "40",
  "llm_answer": "40",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows various events in a basketball game, including \"Missed Shot.\" We need to focus on the nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and their corresponding counts.\n\n2. **Extract Counts for Missed Shots**: \n   - In the first pathway, there are 2 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n   - In the second pathway, there are 19 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n   - In the fifth pathway, there are 19 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Missed Shots**: To find the total number of missed shots, we add the counts from all relevant pathways.\n   - Total Missed Shots = 2 (from the first pathway) + 19 (from the second pathway) + 19 (from the fifth pathway)\n   - Total Missed Shots = 2 + 19 + 19 = 40\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the node-link diagram and summing the counts of \"Missed Shot\" events across all pathways, we can determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>40</answer>",
