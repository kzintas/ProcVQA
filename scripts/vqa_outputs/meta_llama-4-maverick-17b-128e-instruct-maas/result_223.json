  "question": "How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "20",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways and counts associated with UNC Offense.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Pathways**: The diagram shows several sequences of events starting from \"_Start\" and leading to various outcomes. We are interested in sequences that involve \"UNC Offense\" and result in a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Diagram**: The diagram is divided into multiple columns representing different sequences of events. We need to look for columns that start with \"UNC Offense\" and trace the paths to \"Made Shot.\"\n\n3. **Count the Made Shots by UNC Offense**: \n   - In the second column, \"UNC Offense\" (13) leads to \"Foul\" (13), and then to \"Made Free Throw\" (12), but this is not a shot made by UNC Offense directly; it's a free throw.\n   - In the third column, \"UNC Offense\" (26) leads to \"Rebound\" (26), then to \"Missed Shot\" (25), and some sequences lead to \"Made Shot\" (20). The \"Made Shot\" here is directly related to UNC Offense.\n   - In the fourth column, \"UNC Offense\" (21) directly leads to \"Made Shot\" (20).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Made Shots by UNC Offense**: From the third and fourth columns, we see that \"Made Shot\" counts associated with UNC Offense are 20 (in the third column) and there's no direct \"Made Shot\" count in the fourth column that is labeled as such, but it has 21 sequences starting with \"UNC Offense.\" However, the direct count of \"Made Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" is seen in the third column as 20.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The total number of shots made by UNC Offense is directly observed in the third column as 20.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>20</answer>",
