  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and proceeding through various stages including \"UNC Offense,\" \"Made Shot,\" and \"UMD Offense.\" By tracing the path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot,\" we find that there are 22 instances of \"Made Shot.\" This count directly answers the question as it represents the number of made shots after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense.\"",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram carefully.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense,\" \"Made Shot,\" and \"UMD Offense.\" We also need to look at the links connecting these nodes.\n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: Starting from \"UNC Offense,\" there are three possible paths: \"Made Shot,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and \"Foul.\" We are interested in sequences that lead to \"Made Shot\" before reaching \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n3. **Count Made Shots**: The node \"Made Shot\" is directly connected to \"UNC Offense\" with a link labeled \"22.\" This indicates that there were 22 instances where \"Made Shot\" occurred after \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n4. **Check if UMD Offense Follows**: We need to verify if \"UMD Offense\" follows \"Made Shot.\" The diagram shows that \"UMD Offense\" is indeed a subsequent event after \"Made Shot\" (among other paths). The link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" is labeled \"8,\" but more importantly, there's a direct count of 22 for \"Made Shot\" after \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since 22 \"Made Shot\" events occurred after \"UNC Offense,\" and these events precede \"UMD Offense\" in the sequence, we can conclude that there were 22 made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and proceeding through various stages including \"UNC Offense,\" \"Made Shot,\" and \"UMD Offense.\" By tracing the path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot,\" we find that there are 22 instances of \"Made Shot.\" This count directly answers the question as it represents the number of made shots after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense.\"\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>22</answer>",
