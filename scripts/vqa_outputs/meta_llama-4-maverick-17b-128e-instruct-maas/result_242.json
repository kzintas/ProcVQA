  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and count the occurrences of \"Missed Shot\" for each team.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes**: The diagram shows several sequences of events starting with \"_Start\" and ending with \"_Exit\". We need to identify nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\".\n\n2. **Count Missed Shots**: \n   - In the first sequence, there are 2 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n   - In the second sequence, there are 14 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n   - In the fourth sequence, there are 9 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n   - In the fifth sequence, there are 6 and 12 \"Missed Shot\" events, totaling 18.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts**: Adding these counts together gives us the total number of missed shots. total_missed_shots = 2 + 14 + 9 + (6 + 12) = 2 + 14 + 9 + 18 = 43\n\n4. **Verify Calculation**: We have considered all sequences and counted the \"Missed Shot\" events correctly.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>43</answer>",
