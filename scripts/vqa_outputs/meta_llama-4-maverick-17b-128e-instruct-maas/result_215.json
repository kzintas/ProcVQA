  "full_response": "To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing different events and links indicating the flow between these events. We are interested in the \"Made Free Throw\" events associated with \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Examine the Diagram**: Looking at the diagram, there are two sequences where \"Made Free Throw\" is associated with \"UMD Offense\". The first sequence starts with \"_Start 14\" and goes through \"UNC Offense 14\", \"Rebound 14\", \"Missed Shot 14\", \"Made Free Throw 13\", and ends with \"_Exit 14\". The count for \"Made Free Throw\" here is 13. The second sequence starts with \"_Start 15\" and goes through \"UNC Offense 15\", \"Foul 15\", \"Made Free Throw 8\", \"UMD Offense 8\", and ends with \"_Exit 15\". The count for \"Made Free Throw\" here is 8.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total**: To find the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we add the counts from both sequences. total_free_throws = 13 + 8 = 21\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the node-link diagram, UMD Offense made a total of 21 free throws.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>21</answer>",
