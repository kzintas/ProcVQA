  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows a clear pathway from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1 associated with this link. This count directly answers our question.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of times a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events with nodes representing events and directed links indicating the flow between these events. We are interested in the sequence where \"UNC Offense\" is followed by \"Jump Ball\".\n\n2. **Examine Pathways**: Looking at the diagram, we see that there are multiple pathways starting from \"_Start\" and leading to various outcomes. We need to focus on the pathway that includes \"UNC Offense\" followed by \"Jump Ball\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Sequence**: Upon closer inspection, we find that the sequence \"_Start\" -> \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Jump Ball\" is present. The count associated with \"Jump Ball\" after \"UNC Offense\" is 1.\n\n4. **Calculate the Answer**: The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" has a count of 1. This indicates that there is 1 instance where \"Jump Ball\" occurred after \"UNC Offense\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the node-link diagram, we can conclude that a jump ball occurred once after UNC Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a clear pathway from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1 associated with this link. This count directly answers our question.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
