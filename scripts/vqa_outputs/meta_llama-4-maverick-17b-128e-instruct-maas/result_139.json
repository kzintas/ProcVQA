  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to examine the node-link diagram and analyze the transitions from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this visualization are the nodes and links directly connected to \"UMD Offense\". The node-link diagram shows that \"UMD Offense\" is followed by three different paths: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n\n2. **Analyze Transitions from UMD Offense**: \n   - The total number of sequences that reached \"UMD Offense\" is 69, as indicated by the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n   - From \"UMD Offense\", there are three outgoing links with the following counts: \n     - To \"Rebound\": 34\n     - To \"Missed Shot\": 14\n     - To \"_Exit\": 21\n\n3. **Calculate Non-Rebound Transitions**: To find out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to sum the counts of the other two paths (\"Missed Shot\" and \"_Exit\") because these represent the sequences where \"UMD Offense\" did not lead to \"Rebound\".\n   - Count for \"Missed Shot\": 14\n   - Count for \"_Exit\": 21\n   - Total count for not transitioning to \"Rebound\" = 14 + 21 = 35\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the diagram, we see that UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>35</answer>",
