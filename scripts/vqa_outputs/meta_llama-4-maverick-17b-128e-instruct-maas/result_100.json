  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram provides two pathways ending in \"Discharge-Alive\" with counts of 37 and 20. To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we sum these counts.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows different pathways of patients through various stages in a hospital setting. We are interested in the \"Discharge-Alive\" node as it directly relates to our question.\n\n2. **Locate \"Discharge-Alive\" Nodes**: Upon examining the diagram, we find two instances where \"Discharge-Alive\" is mentioned: once associated with 37 sequences and another with 20 sequences.\n\n3. **Extract Counts for \"Discharge-Alive\"**: \n   - The count associated with the first \"Discharge-Alive\" is 37.\n   - The count associated with the second \"Discharge-Alive\" is 20.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Patients Discharged Alive**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts from both instances.\n   - Total = 37 + 20 = 57\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the node-link diagram and summing the counts associated with \"Discharge-Alive,\" we can determine the total number of patients discharged alive.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram provides two pathways ending in \"Discharge-Alive\" with counts of 37 and 20. To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we sum these counts.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>57</answer>",
