  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to carefully examine the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Pathways**: We need to identify all pathways that start with \"UNC Offense\" and eventually lead to \"UMD Offense\". The diagram shows multiple sequences of events starting with \"UNC Offense\".\n\n2. **Track Events Between UNC Offense and UMD Offense**: For each pathway starting with \"UNC Offense\", we need to track the events that occur before \"UMD Offense\". The relevant events are \"Missed Shot\" and other intermediate events.\n\n3. **Count Missed Shots**: We will count the number of \"Missed Shot\" events in the pathways between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see the following relevant pathways and counts:\n\n- In the second column: \"UNC Offense\" (14) -> \"Rebound\" (14) -> \"Missed Shot\" (14) -> \"Made Free Throw\" (10) -> \"UMD Offense\" (13). Here, there are 14 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n- In the fourth column: \"UNC Offense\" (9) -> \"Missed Shot\" (9) -> \"UMD Offense\" (8). Here, there are 9 \"Missed Shot\" events.\n- In the fifth column: \"UNC Offense\" (18) -> \"Steal\" (6) -> \"UMD Offense\" (10) is one path, and \"UNC Offense\" (18) -> \"Missed Shot\" (9) -> \"Made Shot\" (17) -> \"Rebound\" (8) -> \"Missed Shot\" (6) -> \"UMD Offense\" (15) is another. The total \"Missed Shot\" count here is 9 + 6 = 15.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Missed Shots**: Sum the counts of \"Missed Shot\" from all relevant pathways. total_missed_shots = 14 (from the second column) + 9 (from the fourth column) + 15 (from the fifth column) = 38.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram provides a visual representation of sequences of events. By examining the pathways that start with \"UNC Offense\" and lead to \"UMD Offense\", we identified the counts of \"Missed Shot\" events occurring between these two events. The total count is derived by summing the \"Missed Shot\" events from the relevant pathways.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>38</answer>",
