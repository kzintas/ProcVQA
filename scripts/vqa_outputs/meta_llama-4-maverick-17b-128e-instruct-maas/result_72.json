  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram provides four distinct pathways for patients. We focus on the pathways that end with \"Discharge-Alive.\" There are two such pathways: one with 37 patients and another with 20 patients. By adding these counts together, we obtain the total number of patients discharged alive.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows different pathways representing patient sequences through various events. We are interested in the \"Discharge-Alive\" event as it directly relates to our question.\n\n2. **Locate \"Discharge-Alive\" Events**: Upon examining the diagram, we find that there are two instances where \"Discharge-Alive\" is mentioned: one with a count of 37 and another with a count of 20.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Patients Discharged Alive**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we simply add the counts associated with the \"Discharge-Alive\" events. total_discharged_alive = 37 + 20 = 57\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the node-link diagram and summing the counts of \"Discharge-Alive\" events, we can determine the total number of patients discharged alive.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram provides four distinct pathways for patients. We focus on the pathways that end with \"Discharge-Alive.\" There are two such pathways: one with 37 patients and another with 20 patients. By adding these counts together, we obtain the total number of patients discharged alive.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>57</answer>",
