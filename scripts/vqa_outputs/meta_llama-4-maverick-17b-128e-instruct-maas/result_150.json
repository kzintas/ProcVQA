  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The total shots made by UMD Offense can be determined by summing the counts of the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\". The counts are 34 for the link to \"Rebound\" and 35 for the link to \"_Exit\", summing to 69.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total shots made by UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" and ending at \"_Exit\". The relevant nodes for our question are \"UMD Offense\", and the links connected to it.\n\n2. **Understand the Diagram**: The diagram indicates that there are 69 sequences that reach \"UMD Offense\" from \"UNC Offense\". The node \"UMD Offense\" has two outgoing links, one leading to \"Rebound\" and the other directly to \"_Exit\".\n\n3. **Analyze Outgoing Links from UMD Offense**: \n   - The link to \"Rebound\" has a count of 34.\n   - The link directly to \"_Exit\" has a count of 35.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Shots Made by UMD Offense**: The total number of sequences that went through \"UMD Offense\" is the sum of its outgoing links because all sequences that reach \"UMD Offense\" must continue through one of these paths. Therefore, total shots = 34 (leading to \"Rebound\") + 35 (leading directly to \"_Exit\").\n\n5. **Perform Calculation**: Total shots = 34 + 35 = 69.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total shots made by UMD Offense can be determined by summing the counts of the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\". The counts are 34 for the link to \"Rebound\" and 35 for the link to \"_Exit\", summing to 69.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
