  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "16",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing events and links indicating the flow between these events. We are looking for \"Made Free Throw\" events associated with \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. **Examine the Diagram**: Upon examining the diagram, we notice that there are two instances where \"Made Free Throw\" is mentioned: one with a count of 10 and another with a count of 6.\n\n3. **Associate with UMD Offense**: We need to verify if these \"Made Free Throw\" events are associated with \"UMD Offense\". The diagram shows that the sequence starting with \"_Start\" and followed by \"UNC Offense\" leads to \"Rebound\", then \"Foul\", and subsequently \"Made Free Throw\" with a count of 10. Another sequence shows \"Made Free Throw\" with a count of 6, also following a \"Foul\".\n\n4. **Calculate the Total**: To find the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we should look for \"Made Free Throw\" directly linked to or associated with \"UMD Offense\". However, the direct association is not explicitly shown; instead, we see \"Made Free Throw\" counts (10 and 6) following \"Foul\", which is a consequence of \"UNC Offense\". Since \"UMD Offense\" is not directly linked to \"Made Free Throw\" in the provided OCR text, we infer based on the context that the relevant \"Made Free Throw\" counts are those following a foul, which is a result of the opposing team's offense.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The counts of \"Made Free Throw\" are 10 and 6. These are the total counts for made free throws following fouls, which are associated with the opposing team's offense (UNC Offense). Thus, these counts are relevant to UMD Offense as they are the ones benefiting from the free throws.\n\n6. **Sum the Counts**: To find the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we sum the counts: 10 + 6 = 16.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>16</answer>",
