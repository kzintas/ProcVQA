  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The count of transitions from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is directly shown in the visualization. Since all 69 sequences that start with \"UNC Offense\" continue to \"UMD Offense,\" the count is 69.",
  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequences of events in a basketball game. To determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to examine the link between these two nodes.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements are the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" and the link between them.\n   \n2. **Analyze the Link**: The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" represents the transition from one team's offense to the other's. The number next to this link indicates the count of such transitions.\n\n3. **Extract the Count**: The count of sequences transitioning from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is directly labeled on the link between these two nodes.\n\n4. **Determine the Answer**: The diagram shows that there are 69 sequences that start with \"UNC Offense,\" and all of them transition to \"UMD Offense.\" This is indicated by the label \"69\" next to the link from \"_Start\" to \"UNC Offense\" and the same count continuing to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n<reasoning>\nThe count of transitions from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is directly shown in the visualization. Since all 69 sequences that start with \"UNC Offense\" continue to \"UMD Offense,\" the count is 69.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
