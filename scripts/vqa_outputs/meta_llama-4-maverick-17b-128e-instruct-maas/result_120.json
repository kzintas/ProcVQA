  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": "10",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that there are two pathways where \"Foul\" leads to \"Made Free Throw _Exit\". The counts associated with these pathways are 4 and 6. By summing these counts, we can determine the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\nThe relevant elements in the visualization are:\n- The node \"UMD Offense\" and its subsequent links and nodes.\n- The nodes \"Foul\" that follow \"UMD Offense\" and their subsequent links to \"Made Free Throw _Exit\".\n\nUpon examining the diagram, we see that \"UMD Offense\" has three subsequent nodes: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"Foul\" and \"Made Shot\". The \"Foul\" node is connected to \"Made Free Throw _Exit\" in two instances.\n\n1. The first instance is after \"Rebound\" with a count of 4 (from \"Foul\" to \"Made Free Throw _Exit\").\n2. The second instance is directly after \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 6 (from \"Foul\" to \"Made Free Throw _Exit\").\n\nTo calculate the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we sum the counts from these two pathways:\n- 4 (from the pathway after \"Rebound\")\n- 6 (from the direct pathway after \"UMD Offense\")\n\nThus, the total number of free throws made is 4 + 6 = 10.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that there are two pathways where \"Foul\" leads to \"Made Free Throw _Exit\". The counts associated with these pathways are 4 and 6. By summing these counts, we can determine the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>10</answer>",
