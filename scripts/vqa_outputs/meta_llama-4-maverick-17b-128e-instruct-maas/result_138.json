  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The count on the link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" is 69. This indicates that 69 sequences transitioned from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.",
  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequences of events, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links. The link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" has a count of 69.\n\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to examine the link between these two nodes.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\nThe relevant elements are the nodes \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" and the directed link between them.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\"\nThe link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" has a count of 69, indicating that 69 sequences transitioned from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of transitions from UNC Offense to UMD Offense\nSince the count on the link represents the number of sequences that transitioned from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\", we can directly use this count to answer the question.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe count on the link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" is 69. This indicates that 69 sequences transitioned from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 69 times.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
