  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The total shots made, as per the diagram, is related to the count after \"Rebound.\" Thus, we directly observe that 15 shots were made after rebounding, which is the only \"Made Shot\" count available.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of shots made by UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes and links associated with \"UMD Offense\" and the subsequent events.\n\n2. **Analyze the Diagram**: \n   - The diagram starts with \"_Start\" and proceeds to \"UNC Offense,\" which then leads to \"UMD Offense.\"\n   - \"UMD Offense\" has three outgoing paths: \"Rebound,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and another path directly to \"_Exit.\" The counts for these paths are 34, 14, and 21, respectively.\n   - The path to \"Rebound\" further branches into \"Made Shot\" and \"_Exit\" with counts of 15 and 19, respectively.\n   - The \"Made Shot\" node has a count of 15 and leads to \"_Exit.\"\n\n3. **Calculate Total Shots Made by UMD Offense**:\n   - To find the total shots made by UMD Offense, we need to look at the sequences that involve a shot being made.\n   - The direct count of \"Made Shot\" is 15. This is the only path where a shot is explicitly made after \"UMD Offense.\"\n   - There is no direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Shot.\" The \"Made Shot\" occurs after \"Rebound,\" indicating it is a result of a previous shot.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - The total number of sequences that reach \"UMD Offense\" is 69.\n   - Out of these, 34 sequences lead to \"Rebound,\" 14 to \"Missed Shot,\" and 21 directly to \"_Exit.\"\n   - After \"Rebound,\" 15 sequences result in \"Made Shot.\"\n   - The question asks for the total shots made by UMD Offense. Since \"Made Shot\" occurs after \"Rebound\" and not directly from \"UMD Offense,\" we infer that the shot made is a result of the rebound, not directly by UMD Offense's initial action.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The diagram does not directly show shots made by UMD Offense; it shows a \"Made Shot\" after \"Rebound.\"\n   - The count of \"Made Shot\" is 15.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total shots made, as per the diagram, is related to the count after \"Rebound.\" Thus, we directly observe that 15 shots were made after rebounding, which is the only \"Made Shot\" count available.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
