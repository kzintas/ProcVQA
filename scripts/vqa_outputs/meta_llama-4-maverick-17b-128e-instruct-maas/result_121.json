  "question": "How many Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" down to \"_Exit\". We focus on the path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The link between these two nodes is labeled with the count '34', indicating that 34 sequences proceeded from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this diagram are the nodes and links associated with \"UMD Offense\" and \"Rebound\". \n   \n2. **Analyze the Diagram**: The diagram shows that after \"UMD Offense\", there are four possible paths: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", and \"Made Shot\". The link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Rebound\" is labeled with the number 34.\n\n3. **Reasoning**: The number next to the link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Rebound\" directly indicates the count of sequences that followed this path. Therefore, the count of \"Rebound\" after \"UMD Offense\" is 34.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the diagram, the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense is 34.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram illustrates the sequence of events starting from \"_Start\" down to \"_Exit\". We focus on the path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The link between these two nodes is labeled with the count '34', indicating that 34 sequences proceeded from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
