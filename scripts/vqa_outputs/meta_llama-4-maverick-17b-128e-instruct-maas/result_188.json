  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram does not provide information on \"steals\". The paths from \"UMD Offense\" are to \"Rebound\" (34 sequences) and \"_Exit\" (22 sequences), with no indication of \"steals\".",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense, we need to examine the node-link diagram provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Elements**: The relevant elements in this visualization are the nodes and links related to \"UMD Offense\". We need to look at the links coming out of the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n2. **Examine Links from UMD Offense**: The node-link diagram shows that from \"UMD Offense\", there are two outgoing links. One leads to \"Rebound\" and the other to \"_Exit\".\n\n3. **Analyze Link Labels**: The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with '34', indicating 34 sequences follow this path. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" is labeled with '22', indicating 22 sequences follow this path.\n\n4. **Determine Steals**: The diagram does not explicitly mention \"steals\". However, we can infer that the paths following \"UMD Offense\" could involve various outcomes, but \"steals\" are not directly represented. The paths shown are to \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\". Since \"steals\" are not labeled, we must consider if either of these paths could represent a steal or if there's an implication of a steal.\n\n5. **Reasoning**: Upon closer inspection, there's no direct indication of \"steals\" in the provided diagram. The paths from \"UMD Offense\" are to \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\", with no mention or implication of \"steals\". Therefore, based on the information given in the diagram, we cannot determine the number of steals that occurred after \"UMD Offense\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since \"steals\" are not represented in the diagram, the number of steals after \"UMD Offense\" cannot be determined from the given visualization.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram does not provide information on \"steals\". The paths from \"UMD Offense\" are to \"Rebound\" (34 sequences) and \"_Exit\" (22 sequences), with no indication of \"steals\".\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
