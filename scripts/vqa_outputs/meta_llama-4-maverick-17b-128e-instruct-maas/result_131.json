  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram provides the counts for each path following \"UMD Offense.\" By summing the counts for paths that do not lead to \"Rebound,\" we can determine the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to examine the node-link diagram and analyze the pathways following the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant elements**: The node-link diagram shows that after \"UMD Offense,\" there are three possible paths: \"Rebound,\" \"Missed Shot,\" and \"_Exit.\" The counts associated with these paths are 34 (Rebound), 14 (Missed Shot), and 21 (_Exit).\n\n2. **Analyze the pathways**: The total number of sequences that proceeded from \"UMD Offense\" is the sum of the counts of all paths emanating from it, which is 34 + 14 + 21 = 69.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound**: To find this, we need to look at the paths that did not lead to \"Rebound.\" These are \"Missed Shot\" and \"_Exit\" directly from \"UMD Offense.\" The count for \"Missed Shot\" is 14, and for \"_Exit\" is 21.\n\n4. **Sum the counts for the paths not leading to Rebound**: 14 (Missed Shot) + 21 (_Exit) = 35.\n\nTherefore, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram provides the counts for each path following \"UMD Offense.\" By summing the counts for paths that do not lead to \"Rebound,\" we can determine the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
