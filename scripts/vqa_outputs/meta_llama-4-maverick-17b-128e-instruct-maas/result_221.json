  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant nodes and links.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows several sequences of events related to a basketball game between UNC and UMD. We are interested in the \"Missed Shot\" nodes.\n\n2. **Count Missed Shots for Each Team**: \n   - For UNC, the sequence starting with \"_Start\" (2) leads to \"Missed Shot\" (2).\n   - For UNC, another sequence starting with \"_Start\" (26) leads to \"Rebound\" (26), then \"Missed Shot\" (25).\n   - For UMD, the sequence starting with \"UMD Offense\" (18) leads to \"Missed Shot\" (12).\n   - For UMD, another sequence starting with \"UMD Offense\" (20) leads to \"Missed Shot\" (12).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Missed Shots**:\n   - Total missed shots by UNC = 2 (from the first sequence) + 25 (from the second sequence) = 27.\n   - Total missed shots by UMD = 12 (from the third sequence) + 12 (from the fourth sequence) = 24.\n   \n4. **Sum the Missed Shots**: Total missed shots = 27 (UNC) + 24 (UMD) = 39 + 2 (additional missed shot from the first sequence of UNC) is not needed as we directly count from the given data.\n\nHowever, let's directly count from the given data:\n- The leftmost sequence shows \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 2.\n- The third sequence from the left shows \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 25.\n- The fourth sequence from the left shows \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 12.\n\nThus, the total number of missed shots = 2 + 25 + 12 = 39.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram provides a visual representation of the sequences of events in a basketball game. By examining the diagram, we identified the \"Missed Shot\" nodes for both teams and counted the number of missed shots. The total number of missed shots made by both teams is calculated by summing the counts associated with these nodes.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>39</answer>",
