  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "53",
  "llm_answer": "48",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows three \"Rebound\" events with associated counts. By summing these counts, we can determine the total number of rebounds in the match.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify all instances of \"Rebound\" events.\n\n1. **Identify Rebound Events**: The diagram contains multiple \"Rebound\" nodes. We need to locate each of these nodes and examine their incoming links to determine the count associated with them.\n\n2. **Count Rebounds**: Upon examining the diagram, we find three \"Rebound\" nodes. \n   - The first \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 23.\n   - The second \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 15.\n   - The third \"Rebound\" node is connected to \"UMD Offense\" (further down the diagram) with a count of 6 (and another path with a count of 4).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Rebounds**: To find the total number of rebounds, we sum the counts associated with each \"Rebound\" event.\n   - Total Rebounds = 23 (from the first \"Rebound\") + 15 (from the second \"Rebound\") + 6 + 4 (from the third \"Rebound\") = 23 + 15 + 10 = 48\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows three \"Rebound\" events with associated counts. By summing these counts, we can determine the total number of rebounds in the match.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>48</answer>",
