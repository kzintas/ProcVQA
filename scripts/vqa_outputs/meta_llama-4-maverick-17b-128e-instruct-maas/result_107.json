  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "We identified the relevant nodes in the diagram that correspond to \"Discharge-Alive\". The values associated with these nodes are 37 and 20. To find the total, we add these values: 37 + 20 = 57.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant nodes and their corresponding values.\n\nThe diagram shows four distinct pathways, each representing a sequence of events. We are interested in the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, which indicates the number of patients who were discharged alive.\n\nUpon examining the diagram, we find that there are two instances of the \"Discharge-Alive\" node:\n\n1. In the second pathway from the left, the \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a value of 37.\n2. In the third pathway from the left, the \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a value of 20.\n\nTo calculate the total number of patients discharged alive, we simply add these two values together.\n\n<reasoning>\nWe identified the relevant nodes in the diagram that correspond to \"Discharge-Alive\". The values associated with these nodes are 37 and 20. To find the total, we add these values: 37 + 20 = 57.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>57</answer>",
