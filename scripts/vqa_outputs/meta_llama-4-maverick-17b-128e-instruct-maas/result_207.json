  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant nodes and links.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nodes and Links**: The diagram shows various events in a basketball game, including \"Missed Shot.\" We need to count the occurrences of \"Missed Shot\" for both teams.\n\n2. **Count Missed Shots**: \n   - In the first pathway, \"Missed Shot\" occurs 7 times, and again 6 times, totaling 13 missed shots.\n   - In the second pathway, \"Missed Shot\" occurs 14 times.\n   - In the fourth pathway, \"Missed Shot\" occurs 15 times.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Missed Shots**: \n   - Total missed shots = 14 (from the second pathway) + 13 (from the first pathway) + 15 (from the fourth pathway) = 42\n\n4. **Verify Calculation**: \n   - The calculation is straightforward and based on the counts directly observable from the diagram.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - The total number of missed shots made by both teams is the sum of the counts from all relevant pathways.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>42</answer>",
