  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the flow of patients from the Arrival stage to the Discharge-Alive stage.\n\n*   Starting from the Arrival stage, we see that 100 patients arrived.\n*   From the Arrival stage, 62 patients went to the Emergency stage.\n*   From the Emergency stage, 38 patients went to the ICU stage.\n*   From the ICU stage, 36 patients went to the Discharge-Alive stage.\n*   The link width between the ICU and Discharge-Alive stages indicates that 38 patients were discharged alive.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 38.",
