  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to analyze the node-link diagram.\n\nFirst, we identify the nodes representing the \"Arrival\" event in the Emergency department. There are two such nodes, one with 12 patients and another with 37 patients.\n\nNext, we look for links connecting these \"Arrival\" nodes to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node in the Emergency department. We find one link with 12 patients and another link with 37 patients.\n\nSince the question asks for patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we only consider the links that directly connect the \"Arrival\" nodes to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\nTherefore, the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency is the sum of the patients in these two links, which is 12 + 37 = 49.",
