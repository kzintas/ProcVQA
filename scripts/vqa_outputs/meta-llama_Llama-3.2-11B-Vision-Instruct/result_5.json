  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to analyze the flow of patients through the system.\n\nFirst, we see that 62 patients enter the ICU. From the ICU, 24 patients go to the Floor, and 2 patients go to the Emergency. The remaining 36 patients die.\n\nNext, we focus on the path from the Floor to Discharge-Alive. We see that 24 patients go to the Floor, and 24 of these patients are discharged alive. This means that 24 patients are discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 24.",
