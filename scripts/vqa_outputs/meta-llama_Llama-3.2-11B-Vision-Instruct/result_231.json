  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": 2,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To answer this question, we need to examine the nodes and links in the diagram that represent UNC Offense and jump balls. We can see that there are two instances where UNC Offense is followed by a jump ball. The first instance is at the top of the diagram, where UNC Offense is connected to a jump ball with a label of \"1\". The second instance is further down the diagram, where UNC Offense is connected to another jump ball with a label of \"8\".\n\nWe can count these instances to determine the total number of times a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense.",
