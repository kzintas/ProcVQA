  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": 59,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To answer this question, we need to follow the path from Emergency to Discharge-Alive. We can see that there are two paths:\n\n*   One path goes from Emergency to Floor (21 patients) and then to Discharge-Alive (38 patients).\n*   Another path goes from Emergency to ICU (41 patients) and then to Floor (24 patients) and then to Discharge-Alive (8 patients).\n\nWe are interested in the number of patients who were discharged alive directly after an Emergency, which means we only consider the first path. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive directly after an Emergency is 21 + 38 = 59.",
