  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the path from the Arrival node to the Discharge-Alive node and then to the Exit node.\n\n1. Start at the Arrival node with 100 patients.\n2. Follow the link to the Emergency node, which has 100 patients.\n3. From the Emergency node, follow the link to the Floor node, which has 41 patients.\n4. From the Floor node, follow the link to the ICU node, which has 24 patients.\n5. From the ICU node, follow the link to the Discharge-Alive node, which has 36 patients.\n6. Finally, from the Discharge-Alive node, follow the link to the Exit node, which has 38 patients.\n\nBy tracing the path, we can see that the number of patients discharged alive is the sum of the patients at the Discharge-Alive node and the Exit node.\n\nTotal patients discharged alive = Patients at Discharge-Alive node + Patients at Exit node\n= 36 + 38\n= 74",
