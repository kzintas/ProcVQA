  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\n*   Start by examining the node-link diagram and identifying the UMD Offense node.\n*   Look for the link that directly follows the UMD Offense node, which represents the event that occurred immediately after UMD Offense.\n*   The link is labeled with the value \"35\", indicating the number of shots taken.\n*   Since the question asks about shots missed, we need to subtract the number of shots taken from the total number of shots attempted.\n*   However, the total number of shots attempted is not explicitly shown in the diagram. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense.",
