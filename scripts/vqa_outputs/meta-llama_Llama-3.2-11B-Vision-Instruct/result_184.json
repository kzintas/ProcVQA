  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\n*   To find the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to identify the link that connects UNC Offense to Made Shot and then to UMD Offense.\n*   Looking at the diagram, we see that there is a link from UNC Offense to Made Shot with a count of 22.\n*   Then, there is a link from Made Shot to Rebound with a count of 15.\n*   Next, there is a link from Rebound to Missed Shot with a count of 24.\n*   Finally, there is a link from Missed Shot to UMD Offense with a count of 15.\n*   However, we are interested in the count of made shots, not rebounds or missed shots.\n*   Therefore, we only consider the link from UNC Offense to Made Shot, which has a count of 22.",
