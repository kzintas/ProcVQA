  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of shots made by the UMD offense, we need to analyze the values associated with each node and link.\n\n*   The \"UMD Offense\" node has a value of 69, which represents the total number of shots attempted.\n*   The link connecting the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Start\" node also has a value of 69, indicating that all 69 shots were made.\n*   The link connecting the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Rebound\" node has a value of 34, which represents the number of rebounds.\n*   The link connecting the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Exit\" node has a value of 35, which represents the number of exits.\n\nSince the value of the link connecting the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Start\" node is equal to the value of the \"UMD Offense\" node, we can conclude that all 69 shots were made.\n\nTherefore, the total number of shots made by the UMD offense is 69.",
