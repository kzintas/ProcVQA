  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the flow of patients from the Arrival stage to the Discharge-Alive stage.\n\n*   Starting from the Arrival stage, we see that 100 patients arrived.\n*   From the Arrival stage, 62 patients went to the Emergency stage.\n*   From the Emergency stage, 38 patients went to the ICU stage.\n*   From the ICU stage, 36 patients died, and 26 patients were discharged alive.\n*   From the ICU stage, 38 patients went to the Discharge-Alive stage.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the sum of the patients discharged alive from the ICU stage and the patients discharged alive from the Discharge-Alive stage.\n\nTotal patients discharged alive = Patients discharged alive from ICU + Patients discharged alive from Discharge-Alive\n= 26 + 38\n= 64",
