From Emergency, 21 patients go to Floor.\n2. From Floor, 41 patients go to ICU.\n3. There are no other paths from Emergency to ICU.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency is the sum of the patients who went from Emergency to Floor and then to ICU.\n\nTotal patients = 21 (from Emergency to Floor) + 41 (from Floor to ICU) = 62",
