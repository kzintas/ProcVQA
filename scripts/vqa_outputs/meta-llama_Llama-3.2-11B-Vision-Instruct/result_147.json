  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": 0,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\n*   To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the paths where UMD Offense is followed by another event.\n*   Looking at the diagram, we see that UMD Offense is followed by UMD Offense again, and then by UNC Offense.\n*   There are no instances where UMD Offense is followed by a Rebound.\n*   Therefore, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound in any of the sequences shown in the diagram.",
