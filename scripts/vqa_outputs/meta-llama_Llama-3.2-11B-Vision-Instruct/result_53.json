  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many patients died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the flow of patients through the diagram.\n\n1. Start at the \"Arrival\" node, which has 100 patients.\n2. Follow the link to the \"Emergency\" node, which has 100 patients.\n3. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two paths: one to the \"ICU\" node and one to the \"Floor\" node.\n4. The path to the \"ICU\" node has 41 patients, and the path to the \"Floor\" node has 21 patients.\n5. From the \"ICU\" node, there is a link to the \"Die\" node, which has 36 patients.\n6. From the \"Floor\" node, there is a link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, which has 38 patients.\n\nBy following the flow of patients through the diagram, we can see that 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
