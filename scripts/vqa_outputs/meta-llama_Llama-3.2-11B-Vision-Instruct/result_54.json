  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the paths from the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes to the \"Exit\" node. There are two paths:\n\n*   Path 1: \"Discharge-Alive\" (38) -> \"Exit\"\n*   Path 2: \"Discharge-Alive\" (24) -> \"Floor\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\" (36) -> \"Exit\"\n\nWe add the numeric labels on these paths to get the total number of patients discharged alive:\n\n38 + 36 = 74\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 74.",
