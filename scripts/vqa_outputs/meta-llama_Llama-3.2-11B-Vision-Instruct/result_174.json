The relevant elements for this question are the nodes and links related to the UMD Offense and the steals that occurred after it.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations in detail.**\n\nTo find the number of steals after UMD Offense, we need to follow the links from the UMD Offense node to the nodes that represent steals. \n\n*   The UMD Offense node has two outgoing links: one to the Made Shot node and one to the Rebound node.\n*   The Made Shot node has an outgoing link to the Missed Shot node, which has an outgoing link to the Foul node. However, there is no link from the Foul node to a steal node.\n*   The Rebound node has an outgoing link to the Missed Shot node, which has an outgoing link to the Foul node. Again, there is no link from the Foul node to a steal node.\n*   However, the Rebound node also has an outgoing link to the Steal node, which indicates that a steal occurred after the rebound.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the required format.**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can see that there is only one link from the Rebound node to the Steal node, indicating that one steal occurred after UMD Offense.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
