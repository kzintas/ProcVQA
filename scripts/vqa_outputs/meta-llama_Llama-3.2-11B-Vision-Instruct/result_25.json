  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to analyze the link connecting the \"Discharge-Alive\" node to the \"Emergency\" node. The link width is proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and the numeric label next to the link shows the exact count of sequences.\n\nThe link width indicates that there are 38 sequences following the path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". This means that 38 patients were discharged alive.",
