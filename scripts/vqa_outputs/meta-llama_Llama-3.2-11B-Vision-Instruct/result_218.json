  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "25",

  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\nThe node-link diagram shows sequences of events, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links. The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom). The diagram includes various events such as \"Jump Ball,\" \"Missed Shot,\" \"Foul,\" \"Made Shot,\" \"Rebound,\" \"UMD Offense,\" and \"UNC Offense.\" The question asks for the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of missed shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to follow the sequence of events in the diagram.\n\n1. Start with the first occurrence of \"UNC Offense\" at the top of the diagram.\n2. Look for the next event that occurs after \"UNC Offense\" and is not \"UMD Offense.\" This is a \"Missed Shot\" with a value of 2.\n3. Continue following the sequence of events until we reach the next \"UMD Offense\" node.\n4. Count the number of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur between the two \"Offense\" nodes.\n\nBy examining the diagram, we can see that there are two \"Missed Shot\" events with values of 2 and 25, respectively. However, the question asks for the total number of missed shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense. Therefore, we only consider the first \"Missed Shot\" event with a value of 2.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the format <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>2</answer>\n\nThe final answer is 2.",
