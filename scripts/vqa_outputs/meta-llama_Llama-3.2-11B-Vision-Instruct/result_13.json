  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the paths from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes. There are two paths:\n\nPath 1: Emergency -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive\nPath 2: Emergency -> ICU -> Discharge-Alive\n\nWe can see that the link from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" has a label of 24, indicating that 24 patients took this path. The link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" also has a label of 24, indicating that 24 patients were discharged alive through this path.\n\nSimilarly, the link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a label of 62, indicating that 62 patients took this path. The link from \"ICU\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of 2, indicating that 2 patients were discharged alive through this path.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of the patients discharged through both paths: 24 + 2 = 26.",
