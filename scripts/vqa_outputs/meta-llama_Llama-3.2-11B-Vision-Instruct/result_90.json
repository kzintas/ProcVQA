  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": 23,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to analyze the flow of patients through the system.\n\nFirst, we observe that 37 patients were discharged alive, as indicated by the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\". This is the starting point for our analysis.\n\nNext, we look at the link from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"Floor\", which indicates that 23 patients went to the Floor. This means that out of the 37 patients discharged alive, 23 of them went to the Floor.\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we can conclude that the number of patients who went to the Floor and were discharged alive is equal to the number of patients who went to the Floor, which is 23.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 23.",
