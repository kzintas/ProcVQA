  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the paths in the diagram.\n\n*   We start at the top node labeled \"Start\".\n*   From \"Start\", there are two paths: one to \"UNC Offense\" and one to \"UMD Offense\".\n*   The path to \"UNC Offense\" has a link width of 69, indicating 69 sequences.\n*   The path to \"UMD Offense\" has a link width of 69, indicating 69 sequences.\n*   From \"UMD Offense\", there are two paths: one to \"Rebound\" and one to \"Exit\".\n*   The path to \"Rebound\" has a link width of 34, indicating 34 sequences.\n*   The path to \"Exit\" has a link width of 35, indicating 35 sequences.\n\nSince we are interested in how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to count the number of sequences that went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Exit\" instead of \"Rebound\".\n\n*   The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Exit\" has a link width of 35, indicating 35 sequences.\n\nTherefore, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.",
  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\n*   The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links.\n*   The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom).\n*   The link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path.\n*   Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the paths in the diagram.\n\n*   We start at the top node labeled \"Start\".\n*   From \"Start\", there are two paths: one to \"UNC Offense\" and one to \"UMD Offense\".\n*   The path to \"UNC Offense\" has a link width of 69, indicating 69 sequences.\n*   The path to \"UMD Offense\" has a link width of 69, indicating 69 sequences.\n*   From \"UMD Offense\", there are two paths: one to \"Rebound\" and one to \"Exit\".\n*   The path to \"Rebound\" has a link width of 34, indicating 34 sequences.\n*   The path to \"Exit\" has a link width of 35, indicating 35 sequences.\n\nSince we are interested in how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to count the number of sequences that went from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Exit\" instead of \"Rebound\".\n\n*   The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Exit\" has a link width of 35, indicating 35 sequences.\n\nTherefore, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.\n\n</reasoning>\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the following format: <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
