  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find the number of steals after UMD Offense, we need to follow the path from UMD Offense to the next event that represents a steal.\n\nFrom UMD Offense, we see a link to Rebound with a value of 34. This indicates that there are 34 rebounds after UMD Offense.\n\nNext, we look for a link from Rebound to an event that represents a steal. We find a link from Rebound to Made Shot with a value of 22, and then another link from Made Shot to Missed Shot with a value of 24. However, there is no link from Missed Shot to a steal event.\n\nInstead, we notice a link from Rebound to Exit with a value of 24. This indicates that there are 24 exits after Rebound.\n\nSince there are no direct links from Rebound to a steal event, we need to consider the possibility that the steal occurred before Rebound. We see a link from UMD Offense to UNC Offense with a value of 69, and then another link from UNC Offense to Made Shot with a value of 22. However, there is no link from Made Shot to a steal event.\n\nWe also notice a link from UMD Offense to UMD Offense with a value of 34. This indicates that there are 34 UMD Offense events after UMD Offense.\n\nBased on the available information, we cannot determine the exact number of steals after UMD Offense. However, we can conclude that there are at least 34 rebounds and 24 exits after UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\nThe node-link diagram shows a sequence of events, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links.
