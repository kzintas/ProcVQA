  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to analyze the nodes and links related to free throws.\n\n*   We start at the top node labeled \"Start\" and follow the link to the node labeled \"UNC Offense\". This link has a label of 69, indicating that there were 69 sequences that followed this path.\n*   From the \"UNC Offense\" node, we follow the link to the node labeled \"UMD Offense\". This link also has a label of 69, indicating that there were 69 sequences that followed this path.\n*   At the \"UMD Offense\" node, we see two outgoing links: one labeled \"Rebound\" and one labeled \"Free Throw\". The \"Free Throw\" link has a label of 14, indicating that there were 14 sequences that followed this path.\n*   From the \"Free Throw\" node, we follow the link to the node labeled \"Made Shot\". This link has a label of 10, indicating that there were 10 sequences that followed this path.\n*   Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 14.",
