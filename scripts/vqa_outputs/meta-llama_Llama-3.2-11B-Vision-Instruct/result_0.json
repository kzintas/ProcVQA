  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": 26,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many patients died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the flow of patients from Arrival to Death.\n\n*   From the node \"Arrival\", 100 patients enter the system.\n*   At the node \"Emergency\", 62 patients are discharged alive, and 38 patients are sent to the ICU.\n*   From the ICU, 36 patients are discharged alive, and 24 patients die.\n*   The remaining 24 patients who died at the ICU are not shown in the diagram, but we can infer that they are part of the 38 patients who were sent to the ICU from the Emergency node.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of the patients who died at the ICU and the patients who died after being discharged alive from the ICU.\n\nTotal deaths = Deaths at ICU + Deaths after discharge from ICU\n= 24 + 0 (since there are no patients shown to die after being discharged alive from the ICU)\n\nHowever, we can see that 24 patients are shown to die at the ICU, and 2 patients are shown to die after being discharged alive from the ICU. Therefore, the correct calculation is:\n\nTotal deaths = Deaths at ICU + Deaths after discharge from ICU\n= 24 + 2\n= 26",
