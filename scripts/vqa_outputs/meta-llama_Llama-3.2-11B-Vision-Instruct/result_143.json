  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo find the total number of fouls made by UMD Offense, we need to count the number of times the \"Foul\" link is connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node. \n\n*   The \"Foul\" link is connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node twice, indicating that UMD Offense committed two fouls.\n*   Additionally, we need to consider the \"Rebound\" link, which is connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node once. However, this link does not represent a foul, so we do not count it towards the total number of fouls.\n*   Therefore, the total number of fouls made by UMD Offense is 2.",
