  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo answer this question, we need to follow the flow of patients from the Floor to the ICU. We can see that there are two paths from the Floor to the ICU:\n\n*   One path has a label \"ICU\" with a value of 23.\n*   Another path has a label \"ICU\" with a value of 24.\n\nWe can also see that there is a path from the Floor to the ICU with a label \"Die\" and a value of 18. However, this path does not lead to the ICU, so we can ignore it.\n\nSince we are only interested in the number of patients who went to the ICU after the Floor, we can add the values of the two paths that lead to the ICU:\n\n23 + 24 = 47\n\nTherefore, 47 patients went to the ICU after the Floor.",
