  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo answer the question, we need to find the number of fouls made after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense.\n\n*   First, we look for the node labeled \"UNC Offense\" and identify the link that connects it to the next event.\n*   The link is labeled \"Foul\" with a value of 8.\n*   This means that 8 fouls were made after UNC Offense.\n*   Next, we look for the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" and identify the link that connects it to the previous event.\n*   The link is labeled \"Foul\" with a value of 7.\n*   This means that 7 fouls were made before UMD Offense.\n*   However, we are interested in the number of fouls made after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense, not including the fouls made during UMD Offense.\n*   Therefore, we subtract the number of fouls made before UMD Offense from the number of fouls made after UNC Offense: 8 - 7 = 1.",
