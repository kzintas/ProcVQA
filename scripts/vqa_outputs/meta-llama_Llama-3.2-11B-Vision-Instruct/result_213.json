  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\nThe node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a basketball game, with each node representing a shot attempt and the links between them indicating the outcome of each shot. The diagram includes various types of shots, such as made shots, missed shots, rebounds, and fouls.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\nTo determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to count the number of made shots for each team. \n\n*   **UNC Offense:** The diagram shows that UNC Offense made 14 shots, with 7 of them being made shots (labeled as \"Made Shot\" with a green square). Additionally, there are 2 more made shots labeled as \"UMD Offense\" but with a green square, indicating they were made by UNC Offense. Therefore, the total number of made shots for UNC Offense is 7 + 2 = 9.\n*   **UMD Offense:** The diagram shows that UMD Offense made 13 shots, with 8 of them being made shots (labeled as \"Made Free Throw\" with a yellow square). There are also 2 more made shots labeled as \"Made Shot\" with a green square, indicating they were made by UMD Offense. Therefore, the total number of made shots for UMD Offense is 8 + 2 = 10.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the format <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>19</answer>\n\nThe total number of made shots by both teams is 19.",
