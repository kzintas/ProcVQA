  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": 2,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To answer this question, we need to follow the flow of patients from the ICU to the Floor. We can see that there are two paths from the ICU: one to the Discharge-Alive stage and another to the Floor.\n\nFrom the ICU to the Discharge-Alive stage, there is only one link, which means only one patient went to the Discharge-Alive stage.\n\nFrom the ICU to the Floor, there are two links, which means two patients went to the Floor.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU is 2.",
