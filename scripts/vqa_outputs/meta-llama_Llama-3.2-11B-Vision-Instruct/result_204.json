  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of missed shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the sequence of events in the diagram.\n\n1. **Identify the start of UNC Offense:** The first node labeled \"UNC Offense\" marks the beginning of the UNC Offense sequence.\n2. **Find the end of UNC Offense:** The next node labeled \"UMD Offense\" marks the end of the UNC Offense sequence.\n3. **Count the missed shots:** We need to count the number of missed shots between the start of UNC Offense and the end of UNC Offense.\n4. **Analyze the nodes:** Looking at the nodes between the start and end of UNC Offense, we find two nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" with values 7 and 14.\n5. **Calculate the total:** Adding the values of the two missed shots, we get a total of 21 missed shots.",
  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\nThe node-link diagram shows sequences of events, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links.
