  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\nThe node-link diagram shows the flow of patients through different stages of care, including ICU, Floor, and Discharge. The relevant elements for this question are the nodes representing ICU and Floor, and the links connecting them.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations in detail.**\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that there are two paths from ICU to Floor:\n\n*   One path has a label \"Die\" with a value of 36, indicating that 36 patients died in the ICU.\n*   The other path has a label \"Exit\" with a value of 26, indicating that 26 patients exited the ICU.\n\nSince the question asks about patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to consider both paths. However, the \"Die\" path does not lead to the Floor, so we can ignore it. The \"Exit\" path leads to the Floor, and the value of 26 indicates that 26 patients exited the ICU and went to the Floor.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the required format.**\n\n<answer>26</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 26",
