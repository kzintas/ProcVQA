  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": 38,
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the flow of patients from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n*   The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one to the \"ICU\" node and one to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n*   The link to the \"ICU\" node has a label of 62, indicating that 62 patients were admitted to the ICU.\n*   The link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a label of 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive.\n*   Since the link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node is directly connected to the \"Emergency\" node, we can conclude that these 38 patients were discharged alive from the emergency department.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.",
