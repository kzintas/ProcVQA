  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": 62,
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the paths from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes. There are two paths:\n\nPath 1: Emergency -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive\nPath 2: Emergency -> Discharge-Alive\n\nThe numeric labels next to the links indicate the number of sequences following each path. For Path 1, the label is 24, and for Path 2, the label is 38.\n\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the number of sequences from both paths:\n\nTotal = 24 (Path 1) + 38 (Path 2) = 62\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 62.",
