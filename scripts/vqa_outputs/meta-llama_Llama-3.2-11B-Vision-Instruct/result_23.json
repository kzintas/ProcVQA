  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": 48,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\nFirst, we see that there are two paths from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", each with a label of \"24\". This indicates that 24 patients took each of these paths.\n\nNext, we notice that there is a link labeled \"2\" connecting the two paths. This link represents the number of patients who took both paths. However, since the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive, we only need to consider the number of patients who took each path separately.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the sum of the number of patients who took each path: 24 + 24 = 48.",
