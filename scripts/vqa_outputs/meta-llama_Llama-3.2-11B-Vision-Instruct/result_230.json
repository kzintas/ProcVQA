The diagram is divided into two sections: the top section shows the shots made by the UNC offense, and the bottom section shows the shots made by the UMD offense.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, we need to examine the top section of the diagram, which shows the shots made by the UNC offense. We can see that there are several nodes in this section, each representing a shot attempt. The nodes are labeled with the number of shots made, and we can count the number of nodes to determine the total number of shots made by the UNC offense.\n\nUpon examining the diagram, we can see that there are 19 nodes in the top section, each representing a shot attempt. The nodes are labeled with the number of shots made, ranging from 1 to 19. We can count the number of nodes to determine the total number of shots made by the UNC offense.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the following format: <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>19</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 19",
