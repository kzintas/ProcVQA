The question asks about the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations in detail.**\n\nLooking at the diagram, we can see that there are two paths that lead from the ICU to the Floor. The first path has a label \"ICU\" followed by \"Floor\" with a value of 23. The second path has a label \"ICU\" followed by \"Floor\" with a value of 24.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU.**\n\nTo find the total number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to add the values of the two paths. Therefore, the total number of patients is 23 + 24 = 47.\n\n**Answer:** 47",
