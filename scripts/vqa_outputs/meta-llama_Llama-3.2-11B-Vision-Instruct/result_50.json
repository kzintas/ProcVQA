The question asks about the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the diagram to determine the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency.**\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that 21 patients went to the Floor after Emergency, and then 36 patients went to the ICU from the Floor. Therefore, the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency is 36.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the thought process and calculations in detail.**\n\nTo answer this question, we need to follow the flow of patients from Emergency to ICU. We start by looking at the node labeled \"Emergency\" and see that 21 patients went to the Floor. Then, we look at the node labeled \"Floor\" and see that 36 patients went to the ICU. Since these two nodes are connected by a link, we can conclude that the 36 patients who went to the ICU did so after being in the Emergency department.\n\n**Step 4: Provide the final answer in the required format.**\n\n<answer>36</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 36",
