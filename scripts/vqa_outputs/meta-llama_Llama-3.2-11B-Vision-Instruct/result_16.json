The relevant elements for this question are the nodes representing ICU and Floor, and the links connecting them.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations in detail.**\n\nTo determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to follow the flow of patients from the ICU node to the Floor node. \n\n*   Starting from the ICU node, we see that there are two links connected to it: one leading to the Floor node and another leading to the Discharge-Alive node.\n*   The link leading to the Floor node has a label \"24\" next to it, indicating that 24 patients went from the ICU to the Floor.\n*   There are no other links or nodes that would affect the number of patients going from the ICU to the Floor.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the required format.**\n\n<answer>24</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 24",
