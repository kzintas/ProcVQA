  "full_response": "**Relevant Elements:**\n\n*   The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a basketball game.\n*   Each event is represented by a node with a label, and the links between nodes indicate the sequence of events.\n*   The diagram includes various types of events, such as shots, rebounds, turnovers, and fouls.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Rebound Events:** We need to identify the nodes that represent rebound events. In the diagram, rebound events are labeled as \"Rebound\" or \"Offensive Rebound\" or \"Defensive Rebound\".\n2.  **Count Rebound Events:** Once we have identified the rebound events, we can count the number of nodes labeled as \"Rebound\". This will give us the total number of rebounds made by both teams.\n3.  **Consider Both Teams:** Since the question asks for the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to consider both teams' rebound events.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe total number of rebounds made by both teams is 20.",
