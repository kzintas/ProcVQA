  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many patients died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the flow of patients from Arrival to Death.\n\n1. Start at the \"Arrival\" node, which has 100 patients.\n2. Follow the link to the \"Emergency\" node, which has 100 patients.\n3. From the \"Emergency\" node, follow the link to the \"ICU\" node, which has 41 patients.\n4. From the \"ICU\" node, follow the link to the \"Floor\" node, which has 24 patients.\n5. From the \"Floor\" node, follow the link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, which has 36 patients.\n6. From the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, follow the link to the \"Exit\" node, which has 38 patients.\n7. From the \"Exit\" node, follow the link to the \"Die\" node, which has 36 patients.\n\nBy following the flow of patients, we can see that 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
