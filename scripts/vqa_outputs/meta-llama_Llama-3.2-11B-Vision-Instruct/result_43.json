  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": 38,
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo answer this question, we need to follow the path from the Emergency node to the Discharge-Alive node. We can see that there are two paths:\n\n*   One path goes from Emergency to Floor, then to Discharge-Alive, and finally to Exit.\n*   Another path goes from Emergency to Discharge-Alive directly.\n\nWe are interested in the second path, as it represents patients who were discharged alive directly after an Emergency.\n\nLooking at the diagram, we can see that the link between Emergency and Discharge-Alive has a label of 38. This means that 38 patients were discharged alive directly after an Emergency.",
