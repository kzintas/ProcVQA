  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo find the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to follow the path from Rebound to Made Shot.\n\n1. Start at the Rebound node.\n2. Follow the link from Rebound to Made Shot.\n3. Count the number of links between Rebound and Made Shot.\n4. Check if there are any other nodes or links that could affect the count.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that there is only one link between Rebound and Made Shot. This means that there is only one shot made directly after a Rebound.",
