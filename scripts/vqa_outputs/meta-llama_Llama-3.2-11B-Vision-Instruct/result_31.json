  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to analyze the paths from Arrival to Discharge-Alive.\n\n*   The path from Arrival to Emergency has a count of 100 patients.\n*   From Emergency, there are two paths: one leading to ICU and another directly to Discharge-Alive. The path to Discharge-Alive has a count of 38 patients.\n*   Since the question asks for patients who were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we only consider the path from Arrival to Discharge-Alive.\n\nTherefore, the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency is 38.",
