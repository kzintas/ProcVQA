  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the path from \"ICU\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\nFirst, we see that 62 patients enter the ICU. From the ICU, 24 patients go to the Floor. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 24 patients are discharged alive. We can do this by looking at the link between \"Floor\" and \"Discharge-Alive\". The label on this link is 24, indicating that 24 patients are discharged alive from the Floor.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 24.",
