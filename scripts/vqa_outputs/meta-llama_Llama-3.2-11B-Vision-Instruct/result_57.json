The diagram shows the flow of patients from the ICU to the Floor.\n\nFirst, we identify the node representing the ICU and the link connecting it to the Floor. The link has a label \"41\" indicating the number of patients who went from the ICU to the Floor.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the node-link diagram, we can conclude that 41 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
