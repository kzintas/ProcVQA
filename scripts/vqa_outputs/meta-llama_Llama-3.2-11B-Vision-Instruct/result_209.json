The relevant elements for this question are the nodes and links representing shots made by the UNC offense.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations in detail.**\n\nTo determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to analyze the nodes and links representing shots made by the UNC offense. We can see that there are several nodes and links representing shots made by the UNC offense, including:\n\n*   A node labeled \"UMD Offense\" with a link to a node labeled \"Made Shot\" (7)\n*   A node labeled \"Rebound\" with a link to a node labeled \"Made Shot\" (14)\n*   A node labeled \"UMD Offense\" with a link to a node labeled \"Made Shot\" (23)\n*   A node labeled \"Rebound\" with a link to a node labeled \"Made Shot\" (11)\n*   A node labeled \"UMD Offense\" with a link to a node labeled \"Made Shot\" (13)\n\nWe can count the number of shots made by the UNC offense by adding up the values of these nodes and links:\n\n7 + 14 + 23 + 11 + 13 = 68\n\nHowever, this count includes shots made by both the UNC offense and the UMD offense. To get the correct count, we need to subtract the number of shots made by the UMD offense:\n\n68 - 23 = 45\n\nTherefore, the UNC offense made 45 shots.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the required format.**\n\n<answer>45</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 45",
