  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo answer the question, we need to identify the nodes that represent made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.\n\n*   First, we locate the node labeled \"UNC Offense\" at the top of the diagram.\n*   Next, we look for nodes that are connected to \"UNC Offense\" and represent made shots.\n*   We find two nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" with values 22 and 15, respectively.\n*   These nodes are connected to \"UNC Offense\" and represent made shots after UNC Offense.\n*   However, we also need to consider the nodes that represent made shots before UMD Offense.\n*   We find another node labeled \"Made Shot\" with a value of 27, which is connected to \"UMD Offense\".\n*   Since this node represents a made shot before UMD Offense, we subtract its value from the total number of made shots after UNC Offense.\n*   Therefore, the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is 22 + 15 - 27 = 10.",
