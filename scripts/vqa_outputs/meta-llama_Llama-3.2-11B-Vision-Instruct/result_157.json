  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\nThe node-link diagram shows a sequence of events, including Rebound and shots made. The relevant elements are:\n\n*   A Rebound node\n*   Two Shot nodes connected to the Rebound node\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations in XML tags.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to analyze the connections between the Rebound node and the Shot nodes.\n\n*   The Rebound node is connected to two Shot nodes.\n*   Each connection represents a shot made directly after a Rebound.\n*   The number of shots made directly after a Rebound is equal to the number of connections between the Rebound node and the Shot nodes.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the format <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>2</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 2",
