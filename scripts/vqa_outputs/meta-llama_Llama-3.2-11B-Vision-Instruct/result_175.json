  "full_response": "**Relevant Elements:**\n\n*   The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a game.\n*   The diagram includes nodes representing different events, such as \"UMD Offense,\" \"Rebound,\" and \"Made Shot.\"\n*   The links between the nodes indicate the flow of the game, with the direction of the link showing the order of the events.\n\n**Thought Process and Calculations:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Node for UMD Offense:** The node labeled \"UMD Offense\" is the starting point for our analysis.\n2.  **Follow the Links:** From the \"UMD Offense\" node, we follow the links to see what events occur next. We find that there are two possible paths: one leading to \"Made Shot\" and another leading to \"Rebound.\"\n3.  **Count the Rebounds:** We are interested in counting the rebounds made after the \"UMD Offense.\" Looking at the link leading to \"Rebound,\" we see that it has a value of 35. This indicates that 35 rebounds were made after the \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n**Answer:**\n\n<answer>35</answer>\n\nThe final answer is 35.",
