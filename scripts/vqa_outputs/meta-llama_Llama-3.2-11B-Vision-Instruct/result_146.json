The links between the nodes indicate the transitions between these events. In this case, we are interested in the transitions from UNC Offense to UMD Offense.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to examine the links between these two nodes. \n\n*   We start by looking at the link labeled \"69\" that connects UNC Offense to UMD Offense. This indicates that there was one transition from UNC Offense to UMD Offense.\n*   Next, we look at the link labeled \"34\" that connects UMD Offense to Rebound. This indicates that there was one transition from UMD Offense to Rebound.\n*   Then, we look at the link labeled \"35\" that connects Rebound to Exit.
