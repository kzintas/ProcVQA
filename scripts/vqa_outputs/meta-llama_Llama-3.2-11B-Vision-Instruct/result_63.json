  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to follow the path from the ICU to the Floor.\n\n1. From the ICU, there are two possible paths: one to the Discharge-Alive node and one to the Die node.\n2. The link from the ICU to the Discharge-Alive node has a value of 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive from the ICU.\n3. The link from the ICU to the Die node has a value of 26, indicating that 26 patients died in the ICU.\n4. Since we are interested in patients who went to the Floor, we only consider the path to the Discharge-Alive node.\n5. Therefore, the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU is equal to the number of patients who were discharged alive from the ICU, which is 38.",
