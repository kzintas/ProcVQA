  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": null,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\n*   The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a basketball game.\n*   The UMD Offense node is connected to the Rebound node through a link labeled \"34\".\n*   The UMD Offense node is also connected to the Missed Shot node through a link labeled \"14\".\n*   The UMD Offense node is connected to the Foul node through a link labeled \"10\".\n*   The UMD Offense node is connected to the Made Shot node through a link labeled \"8\".\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations.**\n\n*   To determine how many times the UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to count the number of times the UMD Offense node is connected to other nodes (Missed Shot, Foul, Made Shot) instead of the Rebound node.\n*   From the diagram, we can see that the UMD Offense node is connected to the Rebound node only once, which is labeled \"34\".\n*   The UMD Offense node is connected to the Missed Shot node twice, which is labeled \"14\".\n*   The UMD Offense node is connected to the Foul node once, which is labeled \"10\".\n*   The UMD Offense node is connected to the Made Shot node once, which is labeled \"8\".\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the answer.**\n\n*   The total number of times the UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is the sum of the connections to the Missed Shot, Foul, and Made Shot nodes.\n*   Total connections = 2 (Missed Shot) + 1 (Foul) + 1 (Made Shot) = 4\n\n**Answer:** 4",
