  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": 38,
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\nTo determine the number of patients discharged alive directly after an Emergency, we need to follow the path from the \"Emergency\" node to the nodes representing discharge or death.\n\nFrom the \"Emergency\" node, there are two possible paths:\n\n*   A path leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node with a value of 38.\n*   A path leading to the \"Die\" node with a value of 21.\n\nSince we are interested in patients discharged alive directly after an Emergency, we only consider the path leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\nThe value next to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node is 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive directly after an Emergency.",
