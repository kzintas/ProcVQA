  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": 18,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense, we need to count the number of times the \"Foul\" node is connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n*   We start at the \"UMD Offense\" node and follow the links to the \"Foul\" node.\n*   We see that there are two links connecting the \"UMD Offense\" node to the \"Foul\" node, each with a label indicating the number of Fouls.\n*   The first link has a label of \"10\", indicating that there were 10 Fouls made by UMD Offense.\n*   The second link has a label of \"8\", indicating that there were 8 additional Fouls made by UMD Offense.\n*   To find the total number of Fouls, we add the number of Fouls on each link: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense is 18.",
