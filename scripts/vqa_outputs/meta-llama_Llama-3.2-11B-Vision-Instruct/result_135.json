The relevant elements for this question are the nodes labeled \"UMD Offense\" and the links connected to them.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of fouls made by UMD Offense, we need to analyze the links connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n*   The link labeled \"Foul\" has a value of 34, indicating that UMD Offense committed 34 fouls.\n*   The link labeled \"Rebound\" has a value of 19, indicating that UMD Offense rebounded the ball 19 times.\n*   The link labeled \"Made Shot\" has a value of 15, indicating that UMD Offense made 15 shots.\n*   The link labeled \"Missed Shot\" has a value of 14, indicating that UMD Offense missed 14 shots.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total number of fouls made by UMD Offense, not the total number of shots made or missed. Therefore, we only consider the link labeled \"Foul\" with a value of 34.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the following format: <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>34</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 34",
