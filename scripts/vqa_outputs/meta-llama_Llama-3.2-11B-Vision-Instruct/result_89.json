  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": 23,
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to follow the path from the ICU to the Floor. We can see that there is a link connecting the ICU to the Floor with a numeric label of 23. This means that 23 patients went from the ICU to the Floor.\n\nWe also need to consider the direction of the flow, which is indicated by the arrows on the links. The arrow points from the ICU to the Floor, indicating that the flow is from the ICU to the Floor.\n\nTherefore, based on the visualization, we can conclude that 23 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
