The relevant elements for this question are the nodes and links representing shots made by the UNC offense.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations in detail.**\n\nTo determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to analyze the nodes and links representing shots made by the UNC offense. We can see that there are several nodes and links representing shots made by the UNC offense, including:\n\n*   A node labeled \"Made Shot\" with a value of 26, indicating that the UNC offense made 26 shots.\n*   A node labeled \"Made Shot\" with a value of 20, indicating that the UNC offense made 20 shots.\n*   A node labeled \"Made Shot\" with a value of 18, indicating that the UNC offense made 18 shots.\n*   A node labeled \"Made Shot\" with a value of 12, indicating that the UNC offense made 12 shots.\n*   A node labeled \"Made Shot\" with a value of 9, indicating that the UNC offense made 9 shots.\n\nWe can add up these values to get the total number of shots made by the UNC offense:\n\n26 + 20 + 18 + 12 + 9 = 85\n\nTherefore, the UNC offense made a total of 85 shots.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the required format.**\n\n<answer>85</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 85",
