  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": 35,
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\n*   To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the links between the nodes.\n*   Starting from the UMD Offense node, we can see that there are two links: one leading to Rebound and another leading to Missed Shot.\n*   Since the question asks about the transition to Rebound, we focus on the link leading to Rebound.\n*   The link leading to Rebound has a label of 34, indicating that there are 34 transitions from UMD Offense to Rebound.\n*   To find the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we subtract the number of transitions to Rebound from the total number of transitions from UMD Offense.\n*   The total number of transitions from UMD Offense is the sum of the labels on all links leaving the UMD Offense node, which is 69.\n*   Therefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is 69 - 34 = 35.",
