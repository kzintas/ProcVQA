  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": 10,
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\n*   To find the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to identify all the nodes labeled \"Free Throw\" and count the number of times they appear.\n*   Looking at the diagram, we can see that there are two nodes labeled \"Free Throw\" under the \"UMD Offense\" section.\n*   One of these nodes has a value of 4, indicating that 4 free throws were made in that particular sequence.\n*   The other node has a value of 6, indicating that 6 free throws were made in that sequence.\n*   Since these nodes represent different sequences of events, we can add the values together to get the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n*   Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 4 + 6 = 10.",
