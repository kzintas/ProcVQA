  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo answer this question, we need to examine the diagram carefully and identify the instances where a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense.\n\nUpon examining the diagram, we can see that there are two instances where a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense:\n\n*   The first instance is located at the top of the diagram, where a jump ball is represented by a small circle with a number \"1\" inside it. This jump ball occurred after UNC Offense.\n*   The second instance is located further down the diagram, where another jump ball is represented by a small circle with a number \"5\" inside it. This jump ball also occurred after UNC Offense.\n\nTherefore, based on the diagram, we can conclude that a jump ball occurred twice after UNC Offense.",
