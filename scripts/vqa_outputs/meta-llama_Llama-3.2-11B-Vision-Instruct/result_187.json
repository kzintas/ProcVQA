  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\n*   To find the number of fouls made after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense, we need to follow the path from UNC Offense to UMD Offense.\n*   Starting from UNC Offense, we see that there are two possible paths: one leading to Made Shot and the other to Rebound.\n*   Following the path to Made Shot, we see that it leads to Missed Shot, which then leads to Rebound.\n*   The path from Rebound leads to UMD Offense.\n*   Counting the number of sequences along this path, we have:\n    *   UNC Offense to Made Shot: 22 sequences\n    *   Made Shot to Missed Shot: 23 sequences\n    *   Missed Shot to Rebound: 15 sequences\n    *   Rebound to UMD Offense: 15 sequences\n*   Therefore, the total number of sequences (and thus fouls) made after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense is 22 + 23 + 15 + 15 = 75.",
