  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": 3,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\n*   The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a basketball game.\n*   The UMD Offense node is connected to the Rebound node through a link labeled \"34\".\n*   The UMD Offense node is also connected to the Missed Shot node through a link labeled \"14\".\n*   The Missed Shot node is connected to the Turnover node through a link labeled \"4\".\n*   The Turnover node is connected to the Foul node through a link labeled \"2\".\n*   The Foul node is connected to the Made Free Throw node through a link labeled \"4\".\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations.**\n\n*   To determine how many times the UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to count the number of times the UMD Offense node is connected to a node other than Rebound.\n*   From the diagram, we can see that the UMD Offense node is connected to the Missed Shot node, which leads to the Turnover node, and then to the Foul node, which leads to the Made Free Throw node.\n*   Therefore, the UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 3 times (once through the Missed Shot-Turnover-Foul sequence and once through the Missed Shot-Turnover sequence).\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer.**\n\n<answer>3</answer>\n\nThe UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 3 times.",
