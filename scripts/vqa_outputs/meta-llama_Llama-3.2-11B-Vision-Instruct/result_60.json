  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the path from Arrival to Discharge-Alive. We can see that 100 patients arrive, and 62 of them go to the Emergency department. From there, 38 patients are discharged alive.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of patients discharged alive by multiplying the number of patients who arrive by the proportion of patients who are discharged alive:\n\nTotal patients discharged alive = (Number of patients who arrive) x (Proportion of patients discharged alive)\n= 100 x (38/62)\n= 61.29 (round down to 61, since we can't have a fraction of a patient)\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that all patients who arrive are either discharged alive or die. In reality, some patients may be transferred to other departments or leave the hospital without being discharged alive. Therefore, we need to consider the number of patients who are discharged alive from the ICU as well.\n\nWe can see that 26 patients are discharged alive from the ICU. Since these patients have already been counted in the previous calculation, we don't need to add them again.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 61.",
