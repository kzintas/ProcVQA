  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": 34,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": ".**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the corresponding numerical labels.\n\n*   The Rebound event is connected to the UNC Offense event, which is then connected to the UMD Offense event.\n*   The numerical label next to the link between Rebound and UNC Offense is 34.\n*   The numerical label next to the link between UNC Offense and UMD Offense is 69.\n*   The numerical label next to the link between UMD Offense and Exit is 35.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, which means we are interested in the count of sequences from Rebound to UNC Offense. Therefore, we only consider the numerical label next to the link between Rebound and UNC Offense, which is 34.",
  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform the answer.**\n\nThe node-link diagram shows a sequence of events, including Rebound, UNC Offense, UMD Offense, and Exit. The diagram also includes numerical labels indicating the count of sequences following each path.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the corresponding numerical labels.\n\n*   The Rebound event is connected to the UNC Offense event, which is then connected to the UMD Offense event.\n*   The numerical label next to the link between Rebound and UNC Offense is 34.\n*   The numerical label next to the link between UNC Offense and UMD Offense is 69.\n*   The numerical label next to the link between UMD Offense and Exit is 35.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, which means we are interested in the count of sequences from Rebound to UNC Offense.
