Specifically, we need to focus on the path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" and count the number of patients at each step.\n\n1. Starting from \"Floor\", we see that 24 patients are discharged alive.\n2. There are no other paths from \"Floor\" that lead to \"Discharge-Alive\", so we do not need to consider any other nodes or links.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer in the following format: <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>24</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 24",
