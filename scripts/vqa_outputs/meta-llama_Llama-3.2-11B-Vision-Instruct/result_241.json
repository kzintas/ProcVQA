The diagram includes various types of shots, such as made shots, missed shots, rebounds, and turnovers.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\n<reasoning>\n\nTo determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to count the number of made shots for each team.\n\n*   **Team 1:** The diagram shows that Team 1 made 14 shots (represented by the blue nodes). We can count these nodes to determine the total number of made shots for Team 1.\n*   **Team 2:** The diagram also shows that Team 2 made 17 shots (represented by the red nodes). We can count these nodes to determine the total number of made shots for Team 2.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of made shots by both teams.**\n\nTotal made shots = Made shots by Team 1 + Made shots by Team 2\n= 14 + 17\n= 31\n\n**Step 4: Provide the final answer in the format <answer>X</answer> where X is the direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>31</answer>\n\n**Answer:** 31",
