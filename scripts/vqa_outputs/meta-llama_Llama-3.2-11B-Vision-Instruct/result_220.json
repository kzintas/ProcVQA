The diagram is divided into two sections, one for each team, with the UNC Offense team on the left and the UMD Offense team on the right.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>.**\n\nTo determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to count the number of nodes that represent made shots for each team.\n\nFor the UNC Offense team, we can see that there are 26 nodes in total, with 13 nodes representing made shots (labeled as \"Made Shot\") and 13 nodes representing missed shots (labeled as \"Missed Shot\").
