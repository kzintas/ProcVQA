  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathways in the node-link diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes. \n\n1. The diagram shows two distinct pathways leading to \"Discharge-Alive\": one from the \"Emergency\" node and another from the \"Floor\" node. \n\n2. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are 38 sequences leading directly to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\n3. From the \"Floor\" node, there are 24 sequences leading to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\n4. To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts from both pathways: 38 (from \"Emergency\") + 24 (from \"Floor\") = 62.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 62.",
