The relevant elements for this question are the \"Made Shot\" nodes and their corresponding values.\n\nThe diagram shows two \"Made Shot\" nodes, one with a value of 20 and the other with a value of 8. These values represent the number of made shots by each team.\n\nTo find the total number of made shots, we need to add the values of the two \"Made Shot\" nodes.\n\nTotal made shots = 20 + 8 = 28\n\nTherefore, the total number of made shots made by both teams is 28.\n\n<answer>28</answer>",
