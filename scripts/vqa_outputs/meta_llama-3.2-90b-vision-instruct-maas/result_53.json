  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node. \n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"Floor\" and another leading to \"ICU\". \n2. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" has a count of 41, indicating that 41 patients went from Emergency to Floor. \n3. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a count of 21, indicating that 21 patients went from Emergency to ICU. \n4. From the \"ICU\" node, there is a link leading to \"Die\" with a count of 21, indicating that 21 patients died after being in ICU. \n\nSince the question specifically asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we only consider the pathway through ICU, as it directly leads to the \"Die\" outcome. Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 21.",
