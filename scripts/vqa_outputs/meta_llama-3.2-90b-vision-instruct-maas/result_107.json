  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify the nodes and links related to discharge-alive events in the diagram. The relevant elements are the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes and their corresponding links. \n\n1. **Identify Discharge-Alive Nodes and Links**: There are two \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes in the diagram, each with a link indicating the number of patients discharged alive. \n\n2. **Calculate Total Discharged Alive**: The first \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a link labeled \"37\", indicating 37 patients were discharged alive from this pathway. The second \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a link labeled \"20\", indicating 20 patients were discharged alive from this pathway. \n\n3. **Sum the Counts**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we sum the counts from both pathways: 37 (from the first pathway) + 20 (from the second pathway) = 57.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the node-link diagram, the total number of patients discharged alive is 57.",
