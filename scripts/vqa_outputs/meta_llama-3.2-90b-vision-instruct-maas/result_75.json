  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\n1. First, we look for the ICU node and its outgoing links. We find that there are two links from the ICU node: one leading to the Floor and another leading to the ICU (which is likely a loop or a recursive path).\n\n2. Next, we examine the link from the ICU to the Floor. We see that this link has a width proportional to the number of sequences following this path, and the numeric label next to the link shows the exact count of sequences.\n\n3. According to the diagram, the link from the ICU to the Floor has a count of 23. This means that 23 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.\n\nTherefore, based on the node-link diagram, we can conclude that 23 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
