  "question": "How many Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a basketball game. The diagram starts with \"_Start\" and then branches out into two paths: \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\". The \"UMD Offense\" path further branches out into three paths: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"Made Shot\".\n\nTo determine how many Rebounds were made by UMD Offense, we need to look at the link width and the numeric label next to the link that connects \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The link width is proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and the numeric label shows the exact count of sequences.\n\nIn this case, the link width is not explicitly shown, but the numeric label next to the link is 34. This means that 34 sequences followed the path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
