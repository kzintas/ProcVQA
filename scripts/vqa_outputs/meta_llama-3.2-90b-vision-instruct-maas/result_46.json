  "true_answer": "24",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To find the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathways from the Floor node to the Discharge-Alive node.\n\n1. From the Floor node, there are two pathways: one leading to the ICU node and another leading directly to the Discharge-Alive node.\n2. The pathway from the Floor node to the ICU node has a link width of 36, indicating that 36 patients followed this path.\n3. The pathway from the Floor node to the Discharge-Alive node has a link width of 24, indicating that 24 patients followed this path.\n4. Since we are only interested in patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor, we can ignore the pathway leading to the ICU node.\n5. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 24.",
