The diagram indicates that 100 patients arrived at the emergency department, and 62 of them were admitted to the ICU. Of those admitted to the ICU, 26 were discharged alive, and 36 died. The remaining 38 patients were discharged alive directly from the emergency department.\n\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to add the number of patients discharged alive from the ICU (26) to the number of patients discharged alive directly from the emergency department (38).\n\n**Total patients discharged alive = 26 + 38 = 64**\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 64.\n\n**Answer:** 64",
