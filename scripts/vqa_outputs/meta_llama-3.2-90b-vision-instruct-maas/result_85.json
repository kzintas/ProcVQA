From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways leading to the \"ICU\" node, each with a count of 12.\n2. From the \"ICU\" node, there is one pathway leading to the \"Die\" node with a count of 12.\n3. Additionally, there is a direct pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node with a count of 18.\n\nTo find the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we add the counts from both pathways:\n\n12 (from ICU) + 18 (direct from Emergency) = 30\n\nTherefore, 30 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
