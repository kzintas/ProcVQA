  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify the nodes and links related to discharge-alive events in the diagram. The relevant nodes are labeled as \"Discharge-Alive\" with an \"_Exit\" label, indicating the end of a patient's journey in the hospital. We can see two such nodes: one with a count of 37 and another with a count of 20. These counts represent the number of patients who were discharged alive from the hospital.\n\nBy adding these counts together, we can find the total number of patients discharged alive. The calculation is as follows:\n\nTotal discharged alive = 37 (from the first \"Discharge-Alive\" node) + 20 (from the second \"Discharge-Alive\" node)\n\nTotal discharged alive = 57\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 57.",
