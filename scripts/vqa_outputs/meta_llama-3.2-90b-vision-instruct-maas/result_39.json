  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to follow the pathway from the ICU node to the Floor node. \n\n1. First, we identify the ICU node and its connections. The ICU node has two outgoing links: one leading to the Floor and another to the _Exit node. \n\n2. We are interested in the link that leads to the Floor. This link has a numeric label indicating the count of sequences following this path. \n\n3. By examining the diagram, we find that the link from the ICU to the Floor has a label showing the count of sequences. \n\n4. The label on this link indicates that 8 patients went from the ICU to the Floor.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the node-link diagram, we can conclude that 8 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
