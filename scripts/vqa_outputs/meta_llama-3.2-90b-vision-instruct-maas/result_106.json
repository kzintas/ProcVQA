  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "30",
  "llm_answer": "18",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathways from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node.\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways: one leading to \"ICU\" and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive\". Since we are interested in patients who died, we focus on the pathway leading to \"ICU\".\n2. From the \"ICU\" node, there are two pathways: one leading to \"Floor\" and another leading to \"Die\". Again, we focus on the pathway leading to \"Die\".\n3. The pathway from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has a link width proportional to the number of sequences following that path, which is labeled as \"18\". This indicates that 18 patients died after arriving at Emergency.\n\nTherefore, based on the node-link diagram, 18 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
