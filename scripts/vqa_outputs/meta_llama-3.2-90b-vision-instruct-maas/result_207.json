  "question": "How many total missed shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "42",
  "llm_answer": null,
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequences of events in a basketball game. The missed shots are represented by the nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and are connected to the nodes representing the teams that made the shots. The link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and the numeric labels next to the links show the exact count of sequences.\n\nTo determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to count the number of missed shots made by each team and add them together.\n\nThe UNC Offense made 7 missed shots, as indicated by the node labeled \"Missed Shot\" with a link width of 7. The UMD Offense made 6 missed shots, as indicated by the node labeled \"Missed Shot\" with a link width of 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of missed shots made by both teams is 7 + 6 = 13.\n\n**Answer:** 13",
