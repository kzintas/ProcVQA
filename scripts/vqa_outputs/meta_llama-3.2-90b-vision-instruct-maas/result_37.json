  "question": "How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "46",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients discharged alive directly after an Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one to the \"Floor\" node and another to the \"ICU\" node.\n2. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" has a count of 21, indicating that 21 patients were sent to the floor after an emergency.\n3. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a count of 41, indicating that 41 patients were sent to the ICU after an emergency.\n4. From the \"Floor\" node, there is a link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node with a count of 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive directly after being on the floor.\n5. From the \"ICU\" node, there is a link to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node with a count of 8, indicating that 8 patients were discharged alive directly after being in the ICU.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive directly after an Emergency is the sum of the counts from the \"Floor\" and \"ICU\" nodes to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node: 38 + 8 = 46.",
