  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "26",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node. \n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"ICU\" and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n2. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a count of 62, indicating that 62 patients were admitted to the ICU after arriving at Emergency. \n3. The link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has a count of 26, indicating that 26 patients died after being admitted to the ICU. \n4. Since the question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we only consider the pathway from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" to \"Die\". \n\nTherefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 26.",
