  "true_answer": "35",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the node-link diagram. The diagram shows that there are two possible transitions from UMD Offense: one to Rebound and one to _Exit. The link width and numeric label next to the link indicate the number of sequences following that path.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that 35 sequences follow the path from UMD Offense to _Exit, which means that 35 times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 35.",
