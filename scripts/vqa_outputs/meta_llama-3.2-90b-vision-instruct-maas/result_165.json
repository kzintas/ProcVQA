  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequences of events in a basketball match. The diagram has several nodes, each representing an event, and links connecting these nodes, indicating the sequence of events. The links are labeled with numbers, which represent the count of sequences following that path.\n\nTo determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to identify all the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and add up the counts of sequences following those nodes.\n\nThere are two nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram. One is connected to the node \"Foul\" with a count of 6, and the other is connected to the node \"Made Shot\" with a count of 7. Additionally, there is another node labeled \"Rebound\" connected to the node \"Turnover\" with a count of 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of rebounds in the match is 6 + 7 + 4 = 17.\n\n**Answer:** 17",
