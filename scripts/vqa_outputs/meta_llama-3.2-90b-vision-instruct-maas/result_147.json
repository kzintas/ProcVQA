  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to analyze the node-link diagram. The diagram shows that there are two possible transitions from UMD Offense: one to Rebound and one to _Exit. The link width and numeric label next to the link indicate the number of sequences following that path.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the link from UMD Offense to Rebound has a width of 34, which means that 34 sequences followed this path. On the other hand, the link from UMD Offense to _Exit has a width of 35, which means that 35 sequences followed this path.\n\nSince we are interested in finding out how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to subtract the number of sequences that transitioned to Rebound from the total number of sequences that transitioned from UMD Offense. Therefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is:\n\n35 (total sequences from UMD Offense) - 34 (sequences that transitioned to Rebound) = 1\n\nSo, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 1 time.",
