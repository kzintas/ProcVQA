  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathways in the node-link diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node from the \"Floor\" node.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant pathways**: We look for links that connect the \"Floor\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. There are two such links, one with a count of 20 and another with a count of 18.\n\n2. **Calculate the total**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we add the counts of these two links. total_discharged_alive = 20 + 18 = 38\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 38.",
