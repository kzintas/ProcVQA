  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify all paths in the diagram that lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node and sum up the counts associated with these paths.\n\n1. **Identify \"Discharge-Alive\" Nodes**: There are two \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes in the diagram. One is directly connected to the \"Emergency\" node, and the other is connected to the \"ICU\" node.\n\n2. **Calculate Counts for Each Path**:\n   - For the path from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", the count is 38.\n   - For the path from \"ICU\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", the count is 24.\n\n3. **Sum Up the Counts**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts from both paths.\n   Total = 38 (from \"Emergency\") + 24 (from \"ICU\") = 62\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 62.",
