  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"ICU\" and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n\nTherefore, based on the node-link diagram, we can conclude that 38 patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
