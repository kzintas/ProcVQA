  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the pathways in the node-link diagram. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Pathways**: The relevant pathways for this question are those that start from \"UNC Offense\" and end before \"UMD Offense\". \n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: \n   - One pathway goes from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" directly. The link width and numeric label next to this link indicate the count of sequences following this path. \n   - Another pathway goes from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" and then to \"Made Shot\". Again, the link widths and numeric labels provide the counts for these segments.\n\n3. **Calculate Made Shots**:\n   - Directly from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\": The numeric label next to this link shows 22 sequences.\n   - From \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\": The numeric labels show 15 sequences from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" and 24 sequences from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\". However, since these are not direct counts of made shots but rather counts of sequences through these nodes, we only consider the direct link for the calculation of made shots.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the direct pathway from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\", there are 22 made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.",
