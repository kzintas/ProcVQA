  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer.**\n\n*   The node-link diagram shows sequences of events, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links forming pathways.\n*   The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom).\n*   Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path.\n*   Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences.\n\n**Step 2: Describe your thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>, showing how you analyzed the diagram.**\n\n*   The diagram shows two pathways: one starting from \"_Start\" and leading to \"UNC Offense\" and another starting from \"_Start\" and leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n*   The link width and numeric label next to the link from \"_Start\" to \"UMD Offense\" indicate that 35 sequences follow this path.\n*   Since the question asks for the total shots made by UMD offense, we can assume that each sequence represents a shot.\n*   Therefore, the total shots made by UMD offense is equal to the number of sequences following the path from \"_Start\" to \"UMD Offense\", which is 35.\n\n**Step 3: Provide your final answer in the following format: <answer>X</answer> where X is your direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n*   <answer>35</answer>",
