  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to examine the node-link diagram and identify the relevant pathways.\n\n1. First, we look for the ICU node and its outgoing links. We find two links: one leading to the Floor and another leading to the ICU.\n2. Next, we examine the link leading to the Floor. We see that it has a label indicating 23 patients.\n3. We also notice that there is another link leading to the ICU, but it does not have a label indicating the number of patients.\n4. Since we are only interested in the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, we can ignore the link leading to the ICU.\n5. Therefore, based on the diagram, we can conclude that 23 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
