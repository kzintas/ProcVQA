  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a basketball game. The diagram is divided into two columns, with the left column representing the UNC offense and the right column representing the UMD offense.\n\nTo determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to count the number of rebounds made by each team and add them together.\n\nIn the left column, there are two rebounds made by the UNC offense, labeled \"Rebound\" with a value of 19. In the right column, there is one rebound made by the UMD offense, labeled \"Rebound\" with a value of 15.\n\nTherefore, the total number of rebounds made by both teams is:\n\n2 (UNC rebounds) + 1 (UMD rebound) = 3\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>3</answer>",
