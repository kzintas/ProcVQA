  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from the Floor node to the Discharge-Alive node. \n\n1. The Floor node has a link with a count of 24 leading to the Discharge-Alive node. This indicates that 24 patients were discharged alive directly from the Floor.\n\n2. There is no other pathway from the Floor to the Discharge-Alive node, so we do not need to consider any other links or nodes for this calculation.\n\n3. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 24.",
