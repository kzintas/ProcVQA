  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node. \n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"_Exit\" with a count of 38 and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a count of 38. However, neither of these links directly leads to the \"Die\" node. \n\n2. We need to find a link that connects to the \"Die\" node. Looking at the diagram, we see that the \"Die\" node is connected to the \"_Exit\" node with a count of 36, but this does not directly come from the \"Emergency\" node. \n\n3. Since there is no direct link from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node, and the counts provided do not explicitly show a path from \"Emergency\" to \"Die\", we cannot determine the exact number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency based solely on the information given in the diagram.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeterminate.",
