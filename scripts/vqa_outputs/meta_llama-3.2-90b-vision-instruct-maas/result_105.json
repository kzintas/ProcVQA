  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "47",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who went to the ICU after the Floor, we need to follow the pathways in the node-link diagram. \n\n1. First, we identify the nodes representing the Floor and the ICU. \n2. We then look for the links connecting these nodes, which indicate the flow of patients from the Floor to the ICU. \n3. The link width and the numeric label next to it provide information about the number of patients who followed this path. \n4. By examining the diagram, we find that there are two links connecting the Floor to the ICU, with one link having a width proportional to 23 patients and the other link having a width proportional to 24 patients. \n5. To find the total number of patients who went to the ICU after the Floor, we add the counts from both links: 23 + 24 = 47.\n\nTherefore, based on the node-link diagram, 47 patients went to the ICU after the Floor.",
