  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathways from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that there are two pathways from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\":\n\n1. The first pathway has a link width of 37, indicating that 37 patients followed this path.\n2. The second pathway also has a link width of 37, indicating that another 37 patients followed this path.\n\nSince these are the only two pathways from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", we can conclude that a total of 37 + 37 = 74 patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
