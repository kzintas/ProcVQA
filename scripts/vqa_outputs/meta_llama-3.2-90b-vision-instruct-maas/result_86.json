  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "44",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify the nodes and links related to discharge in the node-link diagram. The relevant nodes are \"Discharge-Alive\" and the links connecting them to other nodes.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that there are two \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes, each with a link to an \"_Exit\" node. The link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and the numeric labels next to the links show the exact count of sequences.\n\nThe first \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a link to an \"_Exit\" node with a count of 20. The second \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a link to an \"_Exit\" node with a count of 24.\n\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts of the two links: 20 + 24 = 44.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 44.",
