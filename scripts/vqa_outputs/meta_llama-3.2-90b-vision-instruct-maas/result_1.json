  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify the relevant nodes and links in the diagram. The node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" appears twice, indicating two separate pathways leading to discharge. \n\nThe first pathway from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a link width proportional to 38 sequences, and the second pathway from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a link width proportional to 24 sequences. \n\nSince these pathways are mutually exclusive (a patient can only be discharged once), we can add the number of sequences in each pathway to find the total number of patients discharged alive. \n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38 + 24 = 62.",
