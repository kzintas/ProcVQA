  "full_response": "<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathways from the Floor node to the Discharge-Alive node.\n\n1. From the Floor node, there are two pathways: one leading to the ICU node and another leading to the Die node.\n2. The pathway from the Floor node to the ICU node has a link width proportional to 24 sequences, and the pathway from the ICU node to the Discharge-Alive node has a link width proportional to 36 sequences.\n3. The pathway from the Floor node to the Die node has a link width proportional to 21 sequences, but this pathway does not lead to the Discharge-Alive node.\n4. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the sum of the sequences from the Floor node to the ICU node and from the ICU node to the Discharge-Alive node, which is 24 + 36 = 60.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, which includes the patients who went directly from the Floor to the Discharge-Alive node. The link width from the Floor node to the Discharge-Alive node is proportional to 24 sequences. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 60 + 24 = 84.\n\nBut the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, which includes the patients who went from the Floor to the ICU and then to the Discharge-Alive node, and the patients who went directly from the Floor to the Discharge-Alive node.
