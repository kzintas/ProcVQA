  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "74",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify all pathways leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" and sum the counts associated with these pathways.\n\n1. **Identify Pathways to Discharge-Alive:**\n   - There are two distinct pathways leading to \"Discharge-Alive\":\n     - One from \"Emergency\" through \"Floor\" and then directly to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n     - Another from \"ICU\" through \"Die\" and then to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Counts for Each Pathway:**\n   - For the first pathway (\"Emergency\" -> \"Floor\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\"), the count is 38.\n   - For the second pathway (\"ICU\" -> \"Die\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\"), the count is 36.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - Total discharged alive = 38 (first pathway) + 36 (second pathway) = 74\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 74.",
