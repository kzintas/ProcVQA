  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequences of events in a basketball game. The UMD Offense node has two outgoing links: one to the Rebound node and one to the Missed Shot node. The link to the Rebound node has a count of 34, and the link to the Missed Shot node has a count of 14.\n\nTo find the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to subtract the count of the link to the Rebound node from the total count of the UMD Offense node. The total count of the UMD Offense node is 69 (the sum of the counts of the two outgoing links).\n\nTherefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is:\n\n69 - 34 = 35\n\nSo, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 35 times.\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
