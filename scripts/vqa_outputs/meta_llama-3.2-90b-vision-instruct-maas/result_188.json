  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer.**\n\n*   The node-link diagram shows sequences of events, with each event represented by a node and connected by directed links forming pathways.\n*   The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom).\n*   Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path.\n*   Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences.\n\n**Step 2: Describe your thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>, showing how you analyzed the diagram.**\n\n*   The question asks for the number of steals after UMD Offense.\n*   In the diagram, there is no explicit mention of \"steals\" as an event or node.\n*   However, we can infer that a steal might be implied by the transition from UMD Offense to Rebound, as a steal could result in a change of possession leading to a rebound.\n*   The link from UMD Offense to Rebound has a count of 22, indicating 22 sequences followed this path.\n*   Since the question specifically asks for steals after UMD Offense and there's no direct information on steals, we must consider if the transition to Rebound could imply a steal. Without explicit labeling of a steal event, we cannot definitively conclude the number of steals based solely on the provided diagram.\n\n**Step 3: Provide your final answer in the following format: <answer>X</answer> where X is your direct answer or 'indeterminate'.**\n\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
