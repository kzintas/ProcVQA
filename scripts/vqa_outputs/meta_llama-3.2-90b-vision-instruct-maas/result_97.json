  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathways in the node-link diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node from the \"Floor\" node.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant pathways**: We look for links that connect the \"Floor\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. There are two such pathways: one with a link width proportional to 20 sequences and another with a link width proportional to 18 sequences.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of patients**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we add the counts of sequences from both pathways. The first pathway has 20 sequences, and the second pathway has 18 sequences.\n\n3. **Sum the counts**: Total patients discharged alive = 20 (from the first pathway) + 18 (from the second pathway) = 38\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 38.",
