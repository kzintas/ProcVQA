The link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has a count of 26, indicating that 26 patients died after being admitted to the ICU. \n4.

In this case, the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a width proportional to 6 sequences, and the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a width proportional to 14 sequences. Since the question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we are interested in the sequences that do not lead to \"Rebound\". Therefore, we can conclude that UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 14 times.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>14</answer>",

One is connected to the node \"Foul\" with a count of 6, and the other is connected to the node \"Made Shot\" with a count of 7.

We can do this by tracing the pathways through the diagram and counting the number of missed shots that occur after each UNC Offense event.\n\nThe diagram shows that there are three missed shots that occur after UNC Offense:\n\n*   Missed Shot 7 (after UNC Offense 7)\n*   Missed Shot 14 (after UNC Offense 14)\n*   Missed Shot 15 (after UNC Offense 15)\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of missed shots that occur after UMD Offense.
