  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node. \n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to the \"Floor\" node and another leading to the \"ICU\" node. \n2. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" has a count of 21, indicating that 21 patients were sent to the floor. \n3. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a count of 41, indicating that 41 patients were sent to the ICU. \n4. From the \"ICU\" node, there are two outgoing links: one leading to the \"Die\" node and another leading to the \"_Exit\" node. \n5. The link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has a count of 36, indicating that 36 patients died after being in the ICU. \n6. Since we are only interested in the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we can ignore the link from \"ICU\" to \"_Exit\". \n\nTherefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
