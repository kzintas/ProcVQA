  "llm_answer": "30",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathways from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node.\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways leading to the \"Die\" node. One pathway has a link width of 12 and the other has a link width of 18.\n2. The link width represents the number of sequences following that path. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of the link widths of these two pathways.\n3. The sum of the link widths is 12 + 18 = 30.",
