  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequences of events in a basketball game. The relevant elements for this question are the \"Rebound\" nodes and their corresponding link widths.\n\nThere are two \"Rebound\" nodes, one with a link width of 26 and the other with a link width of 17. These link widths represent the number of rebounds made by each team.\n\nTo find the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to add the link widths of the two \"Rebound\" nodes.\n\nTotal Rebounds = Link Width of First Rebound Node + Link Width of Second Rebound Node\n= 26 + 17\n= 43\n\nTherefore, the total number of rebounds made by both teams is 43.\n\n<answer>43</answer>",
