  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathways from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node.\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways leading to the \"Die\" node. One pathway has a link width proportional to 12 sequences, and the other has a link width proportional to 18 sequences.\n\n2. Since the link widths are proportional to the number of sequences, we can add the counts of these two pathways to find the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.\n\n3. The total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 12 + 18 = 30.",
