  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "14",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to examine the pathways originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node. The diagram shows that there are two pathways from \"UMD Offense\": one leading to \"Rebound\" and another leading to \"Missed Shot\". The link width and numeric label next to the link indicate the number of sequences following that path. In this case, the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a width proportional to 6 sequences, and the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a width proportional to 14 sequences. Since the question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we are interested in the sequences that do not lead to \"Rebound\". Therefore, we can conclude that UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 14 times.",
