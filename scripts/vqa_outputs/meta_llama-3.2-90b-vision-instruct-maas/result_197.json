  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization.**\n\n*   The node \"UNC Offense\" has two outgoing links, one labeled \"Made Shot\" and the other labeled \"Missed Shot\".\n*   The node \"UMD Offense\" has an incoming link from the \"Rebound\" node.\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step.**\n\n*   To determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to analyze the links between these nodes.\n*   There is no direct link from UNC Offense to UMD Offense. However, there is a link from UNC Offense to Rebound, and then from Rebound to UMD Offense.\n*   The link from UNC Offense to Rebound has a count of 24, indicating that 24 sequences followed this path.\n*   Since there is only one link from Rebound to UMD Offense, all 24 sequences that reached Rebound will transition to UMD Offense.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer.**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense 24 times.\n\n**Answer:** 24",
