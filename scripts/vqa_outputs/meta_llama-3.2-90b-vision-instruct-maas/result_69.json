  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows the flow of patients through different stages of care. The ICU is one of the stages, and it has two outgoing links: one to Discharge-Alive and one to Die. The link to Discharge-Alive has a count of 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive from the ICU. The link to Die has a count of 36, indicating that 36 patients died after being in the ICU.\n\nSince the question asks how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to look for a link from the ICU to the Floor. However, there is no such link in the diagram. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU.",
