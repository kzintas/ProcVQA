  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify all the nodes and links related to discharge-alive events in the diagram. \n\n1. **Identify Discharge-Alive Nodes**: There are two nodes labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram. One is connected to the \"_Exit\" node with a count of 20, and the other is connected to the \"_Exit\" node with a count of 37.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Discharged Alive**: To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts from both discharge-alive nodes. total_discharged_alive = 20 + 37 = 57\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 57.",
