The diagram shows that 100 patients arrived at the hospital, and 62 of them went to the Emergency department. From there, 38 patients were discharged alive. Since the question asks about patients who went to the Floor, we can assume that the Floor refers to the Emergency department. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 38.",
