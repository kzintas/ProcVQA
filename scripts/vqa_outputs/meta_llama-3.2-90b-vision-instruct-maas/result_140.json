  "full_response": "The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events in a basketball game. The question asks how many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the links that come out of the UMD Offense node. There are two links: one labeled \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14, and another labeled \"_Exit\" with a count of 21.\n\nSince the question asks about shots that were missed immediately after UMD Offense, we only need to consider the link labeled \"Missed Shot\". The count on this link is 14, which means that 14 shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>14</answer>",
