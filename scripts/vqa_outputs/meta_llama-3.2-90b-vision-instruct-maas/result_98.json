The first instance shows 23 patients going from the Floor to the ICU, and the second instance shows 24 patients following the same path. \n\nSince these are the only two pathways that involve the Floor followed by the ICU, we can conclude that a total of 23 + 24 = 47 patients went to the ICU after the Floor.",
