  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Die\" node. \n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"_Exit\" with a count of 62 and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a count of 38. However, neither of these links directly leads to the \"Die\" node.\n\n2. Since there is no direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"Die\", we cannot determine the exact number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency based solely on the provided visualization.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeterminate because the necessary information to calculate the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is not present in the given node-link diagram.",
