  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"_Exit\" node labeled \"Die\". \n\n1. The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"ICU\" and another to \"Discharge-Alive\". Since we are interested in patients who died, we focus on the link leading to \"ICU\".\n\n2. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" has a count of 62, indicating that 62 patients were admitted to the ICU from the Emergency department.\n\n3. From the \"ICU\" node, there are two outgoing links: one leading to \"Die\" and another to \"_Exit\" (labeled \"Discharge-Alive\"). We are interested in the link leading to \"Die\".\n\n4. The link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" has a count of 36, indicating that 36 patients died after being admitted to the ICU from the Emergency department.\n\nTherefore, based on the node-link diagram, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
