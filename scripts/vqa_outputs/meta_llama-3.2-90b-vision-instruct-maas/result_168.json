The question asks how many rebounds were made after UMD Offense.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to follow the path from UMD Offense to Rebound. There are two paths:\n\n*   UMD Offense -> Missed Shot -> Foul -> Rebound (7)\n*   UMD Offense -> Missed Shot -> Rebound (9)\n\nWe can add up the number of rebounds on each path to get the total number of rebounds made after UMD Offense.\n\n7 + 9 = 16\n\nTherefore, 16 rebounds were made after UMD Offense.\n\n**Answer:** 16",
