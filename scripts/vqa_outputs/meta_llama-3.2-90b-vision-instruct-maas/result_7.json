  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathways in the node-link diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes. \n\n1. The first pathway starts from the \"_Start\" node with 100 patients. It then branches into two paths: one leading to the \"ICU\" node and another to the \"Emergency\" node. Since the question is about patients discharged alive, we focus on the path leading to the \"Emergency\" node, as it directly connects to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n2. The \"Emergency\" node has 62 patients. From here, 38 patients are discharged alive directly, as indicated by the link width and the numeric label \"38\" next to the link leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n3. Another path from the \"ICU\" node leads to the \"Floor\" node, which then connects to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node. However, the number of patients following this path is not directly provided in the question's OCR output. Given the information available, we can only calculate the number of patients discharged alive from the \"Emergency\" node.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the provided information, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.",
