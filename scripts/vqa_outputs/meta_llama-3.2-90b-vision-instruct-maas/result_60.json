  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathways in the node-link diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. \n\n1. The diagram starts with the \"_Start\" node, which has a value of 100. This indicates that 100 patients began the process. \n2. From the \"_Start\" node, there are two pathways: one leading to the \"Arrival\" node and another to the \"Emergency\" node. However, since the question specifically asks about patients being discharged alive, we focus on the pathway that leads to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. \n3. The pathway to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node originates from the \"Emergency\" node, which has a value of 62. This means 62 patients went through the emergency process. \n4. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways: one leading to the \"ICU\" node and another directly to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The pathway to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a value of 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive directly from the emergency process. \n5. The pathway to the \"ICU\" node has a value of 26, but since this does not directly lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, we do not include it in our count for patients discharged alive. \n6. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of those discharged directly from the emergency process, which is 38.",
