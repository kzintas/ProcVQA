The diagram shows that there are two paths from Emergency to ICU: one with 21 patients and another with 41 patients. To find the total number of patients who went to the ICU, we need to add these two numbers together.\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of patients on each path from Emergency to ICU.\nPath 1: 21 patients\nPath 2: 41 patients\n\nStep 2: Add the number of patients on each path to find the total number of patients who went to the ICU.\nTotal patients = Path 1 + Path 2 = 21 + 41 = 62\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency is 62.",
