  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to analyze the pathways in the node-link diagram. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Pathways**: The relevant pathways for this question are those that start from \"UNC Offense\" and end before \"UMD Offense\". \n\n2. **Analyze Pathways**: \n   - One pathway goes from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" directly. The link width and numeric label next to this link indicate the count of sequences following this path. However, the exact count is not provided in the OCR output, so we cannot determine the exact number of made shots from this pathway.\n   - Another pathway goes from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" and then to \"Made Shot\". Again, the exact count for this pathway is not provided in the OCR output.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since the exact counts for the relevant pathways are not provided in the OCR output, we cannot accurately calculate the total number of made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense based on the information given.",
