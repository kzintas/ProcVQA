  "full_response": "**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization.**\n\n*   The node \"UNC Offense\" has two outgoing links, one labeled \"Made Shot\" and the other labeled \"Missed Shot\".\n*   The node \"UMD Offense\" has one incoming link from the node \"Rebound\".\n\n**Step 2: Describe the thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step.**\n\n*   To determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to count the number of sequences that follow the path from UNC Offense to UMD Offense.\n*   The link from UNC Offense to Made Shot has a count of 22, and the link from UNC Offense to Missed Shot has a count of 24.\n*   Since there is no direct link from UNC Offense to UMD Offense, we need to consider the indirect paths through Rebound.\n*   The link from Rebound to UMD Offense has a count of 34, but this includes sequences that may not have originated from UNC Offense.\n*   To find the number of sequences that transitioned from UNC Offense to UMD Offense, we need to subtract the count of sequences that did not originate from UNC Offense from the total count of sequences that reached UMD Offense.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the final answer.**\n\n*   Unfortunately, the provided information does not allow us to determine the exact number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, as we cannot accurately calculate the number of sequences that did not originate from UNC Offense.\n\n**Answer:** indeterminate",
