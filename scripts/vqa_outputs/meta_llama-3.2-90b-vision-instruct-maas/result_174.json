  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense, we need to analyze the node-link diagram. The diagram shows the sequence of events, with each event represented by a node and the connections between them indicating the flow of the game.\n\nThe UMD Offense node is connected to several other nodes, including Made Shot, Missed Shot, Foul, and Rebound. We can see that there are 8 sequences that follow the path from UMD Offense to Made Shot, 16 sequences that follow the path from UMD Offense to Missed Shot, 7 sequences that follow the path from UMD Offense to Foul, and 7 sequences that follow the path from UMD Offense to Rebound.\n\nHowever, none of these paths indicate a steal. Therefore, based on the information provided in the node-link diagram, we cannot determine the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense.",
