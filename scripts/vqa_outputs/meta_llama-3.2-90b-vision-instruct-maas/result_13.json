  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify the relevant nodes and links in the diagram. The node \"Discharge-Alive\" appears twice, indicating two separate pathways for discharge. \n\nThe first \"Discharge-Alive\" node is connected to the \"_Exit\" node with a link labeled \"24\". This indicates that 24 patients were discharged alive through this pathway.\n\nThe second \"Discharge-Alive\" node is connected to the \"_Exit\" node with a link labeled \"38\". This indicates that 38 patients were discharged alive through this pathway.\n\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts from both pathways: 24 + 38 = 62.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 62.",
