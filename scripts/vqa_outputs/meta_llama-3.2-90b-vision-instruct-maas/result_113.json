The question asks for the total number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the links that connect the \"Rebound\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node. There are two such links, one with a label of 6 and another with a label of 4.\n\nThe total number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense is the sum of these two values: 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>10</answer>",
