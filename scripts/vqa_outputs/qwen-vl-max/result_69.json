  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",

  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that 62 patients go to the ICU from the Emergency node. Out of these, 36 die. There is no explicit path or node indicating a transition to a \"Floor\" after the ICU. Hence, the number of patients going to the Floor after the ICU cannot be determined from the given visualization.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU, let's analyze the pathways in the node-link diagram:\n\n1. **Start Node**: All 100 patients start at this node.\n2. **Arrival Node**: All 100 patients proceed to the Arrival node.\n3. **Emergency Node**: All 100 patients then move to the Emergency node.\n4. **Branching at Emergency**:\n   - 62 patients go to the ICU.\n   - 38 patients go directly to Discharge-Alive and exit.\n\n5. **ICU Node**: \n   - Of the 62 patients who went to the ICU, 36 patients die.\n   - The remaining 26 patients (62 - 36) should theoretically go to another node labeled \"Floor\" if it existed in the diagram.\n\nHowever, there is no node labeled \"Floor\" in the given visualization. Therefore, we cannot determine from the provided information how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that 62 patients go to the ICU from the Emergency node. Out of these, 36 die. There is no explicit path or node indicating a transition to a \"Floor\" after the ICU.
