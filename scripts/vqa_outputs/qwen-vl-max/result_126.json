  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From \"UMD Offense\", there are two pathways leading to \"Made Shot\":\n   - One pathway has a link value of 8.\n   - Another pathway goes through \"Rebound\" and then to \"Made Shot\" with a link value of 15.\n\n2. Summing these values gives us the total number of shots made:\n   - Direct path: 8\n   - Indirect path through Rebound: 15\n\n3. Total shots made = 8 + 15 = 23",
