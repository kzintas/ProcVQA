  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two possible paths:\n   - One path leads directly to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.\n   - The other path leads to \"Rebound\" and then to \"_Exit,\" also with a count of 34.\n\n2. Since the question asks for the total number of fouls made by UMD Offense, we need to consider both paths as they represent different sequences following UMD Offense.\n\n3. Adding the counts of these two paths gives us the total number of sequences involving UMD Offense: \n   35 (direct exit) + 34 (exit via rebound) = 69.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fouls made by UMD Offense is 69.",
