  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. Identify the total number of sequences starting from UMD Offense: 34 (to Rebound) + 35 (to _Exit) = 69.\n2. Determine the number of sequences that do not go to Rebound: 35 (directly to _Exit).",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to examine the pathways from UMD Offense. \n\n- There are two outgoing links from UMD Offense:\n  - One link leads to Rebound with a count of 34.\n  - The other link leads directly to _Exit with a count of 35.\n\nThe question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound. This corresponds to the number of sequences that follow the path from UMD Offense to _Exit.\n\n<reasoning>\n1. Identify the total number of sequences starting from UMD Offense: 34 (to Rebound) + 35 (to _Exit) = 69.\n2. Determine the number of sequences that do not go to Rebound: 35 (directly to _Exit).\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
