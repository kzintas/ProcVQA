  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows pathways starting from \"UMD Offense\" leading to either \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit.\" There is no node labeled \"Steal\" connected to these pathways. Therefore, no steals occurred after UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from the \"UMD Offense\" node and look for a specific node labeled \"Steal.\" \n\n1. From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n   - One leading to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n   - Another leading to \"_Exit\" with a count of 22.\n\n2. Neither of these pathways leads directly to a node labeled \"Steal.\"\n\n3. Additionally, there is no other pathway originating from any other node that leads back to or intersects with \"UMD Offense\" and then proceeds to a \"Steal\" node.\n\nSince there is no direct path from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Steal\" node, and no indirect paths through other nodes that lead to a \"Steal,\" it can be concluded that there were no steals occurring after UMD Offense based on the given visualization.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows pathways starting from \"UMD Offense\" leading to either \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit.\" There is no node labeled \"Steal\" connected to these pathways. Therefore, no steals occurred after UMD Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>0</answer>",
