  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. From \"UMD Offense\", there are three pathways:\n   - 34 sequences leading to \"Rebound\"\n   - 14 sequences leading directly to \"_Exit\" (implying a missed shot)\n   - 21 sequences leading to \"Missed Shot\"\n\n2. From \"Rebound\", there are two pathways:\n   - 15 sequences leading to \"Made Shot\"\n   - 19 sequences leading to \"_Exit\" (implying another missed shot)\n\n3. The sequences leading to \"Made Shot\" represent successful shots or free throws.\n\n4. Therefore, the total number of free throws made is the sum of sequences leading to \"Made Shot\":\n   - 15 sequences",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from \"UMD Offense\" and identify the sequences that lead to a successful shot.\n\n<reasoning>\n1.
