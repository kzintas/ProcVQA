From \"Arrival,\" 100 patients move to \"Emergency.\"\n2. From \"Emergency,\" there are two pathways:\n   - 62 patients go to \"ICU.\"\n   - 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\nThe question asks for patients who were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, which corresponds to the 38 patients who moved directly from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n<reasoning>\n- Identified the relevant nodes: Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive.\n- Followed the direct path from Emergency to Discharge-Alive.\n- Counted the number of patients on this direct path.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>38</answer>",
