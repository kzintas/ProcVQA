  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. Start with the \"Arrival\" node.\n2. Follow the links to \"Emergency\":\n   - There are four pathways leading from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" with counts 12, 37, 24, and 27.\n3. From \"Emergency\", trace the paths that lead to \"Die _Exit\":\n   - The pathway from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" to \"Die _Exit\" has a count of 18.\n   - No other direct path from \"Emergency\" leads to \"Die _Exit\".\n4. Sum the counts of all pathways leading from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" and then to \"Die _Exit\":\n   - Total = 12 + 37 + 24 + 27 = 100 (total arrivals)\n   - Patients who died: 18",
