Starting from \"Arrival\", all 100 patients move to \"Emergency\".\n2. From \"Emergency\", there are two pathways: one leading to \"ICU\" and another to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is labeled with the number 38.\n\nThis indicates that 38 patients moved directly from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a clear path from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" and then splits into two paths from \"Emergency\".
