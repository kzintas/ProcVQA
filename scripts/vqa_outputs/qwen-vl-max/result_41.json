  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways:\n   - One leading directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 sequences.\n   - Another leading to \"Floor\" with 21 sequences and further splitting into two paths.\n\n2. The path from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" (21 sequences) then splits:\n   - One path leads to \"ICU\" with 41 sequences.\n   - The other path continues directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 21 sequences.\n\n3. From \"ICU\", there are two outcomes:\n   - 24 sequences lead to \"Floor\".\n   - 36 sequences lead to \"Die\".\n\n4. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of sequences leading to \"Die\":\n   - Directly from \"ICU\": 36 sequences.",
