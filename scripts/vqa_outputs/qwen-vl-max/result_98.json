  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows a direct link from the \"Floor\" node to the \"ICU\" node with a numeric label of 24. This indicates that 24 sequences follow this path, meaning 24 patients went to the ICU after being on the Floor.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many patients went to the ICU after the Floor, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the node labeled \"Floor\" in the diagram.\n2. Trace the pathways leading from the \"Floor\" node.\n3. Look for a pathway that leads directly to the \"ICU\" node.\n4. Check the numeric label next to this link to find the count of sequences.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The \"Floor\" node is connected to two other nodes: \"ICU\" and \"Die\".\n- The link from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" has a numeric label of 24.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a direct link from the \"Floor\" node to the \"ICU\" node with a numeric label of 24. This indicates that 24 sequences follow this path, meaning 24 patients went to the ICU after being on the Floor.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
