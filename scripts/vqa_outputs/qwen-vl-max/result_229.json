  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- The \"UMD Offense\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"Missed Shot\" (18 sequences) and another leading to \"Exit\" (15 sequences).\n- There is no direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n- Therefore, based on the given visualization, there are no sequences where UMD Offense directly leads to a made shot, which would typically represent a successful free throw.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to identify the relevant pathways in the node-link diagram:\n\n1. Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n2. Follow the links from this node to see if there is a direct path to a \"Made Shot\" node that could represent a free throw.\n\n<reasoning>\n- The \"UMD Offense\" node has two outgoing links: one leading to \"Missed Shot\" (18 sequences) and another leading to \"Exit\" (15 sequences).\n- There is no direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n- Therefore, based on the given visualization, there are no sequences where UMD Offense directly leads to a made shot, which would typically represent a successful free throw.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>0</answer>",
