There are no nodes or links labeled with 'Foul' or any indication of fouls being recorded. Therefore, based on the given visualization, the number of fouls by UMD Offense cannot be determined.",
  "full_response": "There is no node or link in the provided diagram that explicitly mentions \"Fouls\" or indicates any information related to fouls. The nodes and links shown are \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\", with numerical values next to the links indicating transitions between these states. Since there is no information about fouls, it cannot be determined from this visualization.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows sequences of events starting from '_Start', moving through 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense', then splitting into 'Rebound' and '_Exit'.
