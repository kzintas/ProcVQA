  "full_response": "To determine how many missed shots occurred before UMD Offense, we need to trace the pathways leading from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\" \n\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" there are multiple paths:\n  - 15 sequences lead directly to \"Missed Shot.\"\n  - Another 9 sequences go through \"Rebound\" and then to \"Missed Shot.\"\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of missed shots before UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows two pathways leading to a \"Missed Shot\" node before reaching \"UMD Offense\":\n1.
