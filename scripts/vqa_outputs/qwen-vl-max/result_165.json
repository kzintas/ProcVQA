  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "53",
  "llm_answer": "63",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. There are two main instances of \"Rebound\" nodes:\n   - One under UNC Offense\n   - One under UMD Offense\n\n2. For the rebound under UNC Offense:\n   - It has one incoming link from \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 15.\n   - It has one outgoing link to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 23.\n\n3. For the rebound under UMD Offense:\n   - It has four outgoing links:\n     - To \"Foul\" with a count of 4.\n     - To \"Made Shot\" with a count of 7.\n     - To \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 6.\n     - To \"Turnover\" with a count of 4.\n   - It also has one incoming link from \"Steal\" with a count of 4.\n\n4. Summing up all these counts gives us the total number of rebounds:\n   - 15 (UNC) + 23 (UNC) + 4 (UMD) + 7 (UMD) + 6 (UMD) + 4 (UMD) + 4 (UMD) = 63",
