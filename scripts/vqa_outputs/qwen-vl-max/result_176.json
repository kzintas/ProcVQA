We are interested in the direct transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n3. The link directly connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a numeric label of 22.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that there is a direct path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" labeled with the number 22.
