  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The ICU node has two outgoing links: one to \"Discharge-Alive\" and another to \"Floor\".\n- The link from ICU to Floor is labeled with the number 23.\n- This indicates that 23 sequences followed the path from ICU to Floor.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the node labeled \"ICU\" and trace its outgoing links.\n2. Look for a link leading to the \"Floor\" node.\n3. Read the numeric label next to this link to find the count of sequences.\n\n<reasoning>\n- The ICU node has two outgoing links: one to \"Discharge-Alive\" and another to \"Floor\".\n- The link from ICU to Floor is labeled with the number 23.\n- This indicates that 23 sequences followed the path from ICU to Floor.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>23</answer>",
