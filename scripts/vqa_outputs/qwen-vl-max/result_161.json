  "question": "How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that from UMD Offense, the pathway leading to Rebound involves going through Foul and Made Free Throw. The counts on these links are 7, 4, and 4 respectively. Adding these together gives the total number of rebounds following UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of rebounds made after UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from the \"UMD Offense\" node and count how many times it leads to a \"Rebound\" node.\n\n1. From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two main paths:\n   - One path goes directly to \"_Exit\" (not relevant for rebounds).\n   - The other path leads to \"Foul,\" then \"Made Free Throw,\" and finally to \"Rebound.\"\n\n2. Counting the sequences:\n   - The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" has 7 sequences.\n   - From \"Foul\" to \"Made Free Throw\" has 4 sequences.\n   - From \"Made Free Throw\" to \"Rebound\" has 4 sequences.\n\n3. Summing these up gives us the total number of rebounds after UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that from UMD Offense, the pathway leading to Rebound involves going through Foul and Made Free Throw.
