From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n   - One link leads directly to \"_Exit\" with a count of 34.\n   - Another link leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 22.\n\n2. The link leading to \"Rebound\" indicates that 22 sequences resulted in a rebound after UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that from the \"UMD Offense\" node, there is a direct path to \"Rebound\" with a numeric label of 22.
