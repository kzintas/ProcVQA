  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. Start at the \"_Start\" node.\n2. There are two paths from \"_Start\":\n   - 22 sequences go to \"Made Shot\"\n   - 24 sequences go to \"Missed Shot\"\n3. From \"Made Shot\", there is one path:\n   - 22 sequences go to \"UMD Offense\"\n4. From \"Missed Shot\", there are two paths:\n   - 24 sequences go to \"UMD Offense\"\n   - 24 sequences go directly to \"_Exit\"\n5. From \"UMD Offense\", there are two paths:\n   - 34 sequences go to \"Rebound\"\n   - 22 sequences go directly to \"_Exit\"\n6. The only path leading to \"Rebound\" has 34 sequences.",
