  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two distinct pathways leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. By summing the numeric labels next to the links for each pathway, we can calculate the total number of patients discharged alive.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, I'll track all pathways that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node:\n\n1. From _Start (37) -> Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive (37)\n2. From _Start (24) -> Arrival (24) -> Emergency (24) -> ICU (23) -> Floor (23) -> Discharge-Alive (20)\n\nSumming up the counts from these pathways:\n- Pathway 1: 37 patients\n- Pathway 2: 20 patients\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows two distinct pathways leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.
