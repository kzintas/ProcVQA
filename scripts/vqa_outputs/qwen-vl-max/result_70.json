  "full_response": "To determine the number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathways in the node-link diagram:\n\n1. All 100 patients start at \"Start\".\n2. They all arrive at \"Arrival\".\n3. From \"Arrival\", all 100 patients move to \"Emergency\".\n4. At \"Emergency\", the patients split into two paths:\n   - 62 patients go to \"ICU\".\n   - 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nSince the question asks for patients who were discharged alive after going to the floor, we focus on the path that leads directly from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". \n\n<reasoning>\nThe relevant pathway is from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". The numeric label next to this link indicates that 38 patients took this path.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>38</answer>",
