  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to look at the pathways from UMD Offense. \n\n- From UMD Offense, there are two possible transitions: \n  - One leading to Rebound (34 sequences)\n  - The other leading directly to Missed Shot (21 sequences)\n\nThe question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did not lead to Rebound. This is represented by the pathway that leads directly to Missed Shot.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows:\n1. UMD Offense has two outgoing links.\n2. One link goes to Rebound with a count of 34.\n3.
