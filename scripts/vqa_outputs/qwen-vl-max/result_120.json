  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are two paths leading to \"Foul\":\n   - One path has a count of 6.\n   - Another path has a count of 4.\n\n2. Both these paths further lead to \"Made Free Throw\":\n   - The path with a count of 6 leads to \"Made Free Throw\" and then \"_Exit\".\n   - The path with a count of 4 also leads to \"Made Free Throw\" and then \"_Exit\".\n\n3. Therefore, the total number of free throws made is the sum of these counts:\n   - 6 + 4 = 10.",
