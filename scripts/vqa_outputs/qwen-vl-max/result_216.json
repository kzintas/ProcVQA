  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The relevant pathway starts at \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\". This is the only sequence where a made shot occurs directly after an UNC offense without any UMD offense in between.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, we need to track all pathways that start with \"UNC Offense\" and end with \"Made Shot\" without any other team's offense intervening.\n\n1. Start with the first node labeled \"UNC Offense\".\n2. Follow the links from this node:\n   - The first link leads to \"Missed Shot\" (7 sequences).\n   - The second link leads to \"Rebound\" (14 sequences).\n3. From \"Rebound\", there are two paths:\n   - One path leads back to \"UNC Offense\" (14 sequences).\n   - Another path leads to \"UMD Offense\" (7 sequences).\n\n4. Focus on the path that returns to \"UNC Offense\":\n   - From this \"UNC Offense\", one path leads to \"Made Shot\" (7 sequences).\n\nThus, there are 7 sequences where the shot was made by the UNC offense without any UMD offense intervening.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe relevant pathway starts at \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\". This is the only sequence where a made shot occurs directly after an UNC offense without any UMD offense in between.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>7</answer>",
