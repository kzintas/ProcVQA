  "full_response": "To determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense, I'll follow the pathways starting from \"UMD Offense\" nodes and look for links leading to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n1. Starting from the first \"UMD Offense\" node (grey):\n   - There is no direct link to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n2. Moving to the second \"UMD Offense\" node:\n   - No direct link to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n3. The third \"UMD Offense\" node also does not have a direct link to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\nSince none of the \"UMD Offense\" nodes directly lead to \"Made Free Throw,\" it appears that UMD did not make any free throws based on this visualization.\n\n<reasoning>\n- Traced all pathways originating from \"UMD Offense\" nodes.\n- Found no direct paths leading to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>0</answer>",
