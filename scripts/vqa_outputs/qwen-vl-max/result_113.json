  "question": "How many total Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From \"UMD Offense\", there are two main paths:\n   - One path leads directly to \"Missed Shot\" (14 sequences).\n   - Another path leads to \"Rebound\" (34 sequences).\n\n2. The \"Rebound\" node has multiple outgoing links:\n   - 15 sequences lead to \"Made Shot\".\n   - 9 sequences lead to \"Missed Shot\".\n   - 6 sequences lead to \"Foul\".\n   - 4 sequences lead to \"Turnover\".\n\n3. Summing these values gives the total number of Rebounds: \n   15 + 9 + 6 + 4 = 34.",
