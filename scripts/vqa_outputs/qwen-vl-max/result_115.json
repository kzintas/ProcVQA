  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to identify all pathways from UMD Offense that do not lead to Rebound. \n\nFrom the UMD Offense node:\n- 34 sequences lead to Rebound.\n- 14 sequences lead to Missed Shot.\n- 10 sequences lead to Foul.\n- 8 sequences lead to Made Shot.\n- 3 sequences lead directly to _Exit.\n\nThe sequences that do not go to Rebound are those leading to Missed Shot, Foul, Made Shot, and direct _Exit. Adding these up:\n\n<reasoning>\n14 (Missed Shot) + 10 (Foul) + 8 (Made Shot) + 3 (_Exit) = 35\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
