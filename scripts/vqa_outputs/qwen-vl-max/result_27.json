Look for links originating from this node.\n3. Find the link leading to the \"ICU\" node.\n4. Read the numeric label next to this link.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links.\n- One of these links leads to the \"ICU\" node.\n- The numeric label next to this link is 62.\n\nThis indicates that 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a clear pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"ICU\" node with a numeric label of 62 next to the link.
