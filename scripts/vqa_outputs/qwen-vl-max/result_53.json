  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways: one leading to \"Floor\" and another directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. The pathway to \"Floor\" has a count of 41.\n3. From \"Floor\", there is a further split:\n   - One path leads to \"ICU\" with a count of 21.\n   - Another path leads directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a count of 20 (41 - 21).\n4. From \"ICU\", there are two paths:\n   - One path leads to \"Floor\" with a count of 24.\n   - Another path leads to \"Die\" with a count of 36.\n5. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of those who went through ICU and then died: 36.",
