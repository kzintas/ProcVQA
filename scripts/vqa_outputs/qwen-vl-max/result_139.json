  "reasoning": "1. Identify the total number of sequences starting from UMD Offense: 34 + 14 + 21 = 69.\n2. Identify the number of sequences leading to Rebound: 34.\n3. Calculate the number of sequences not leading to Rebound: 69 - 34 = 35.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to look at the pathways from UMD Offense that do not lead to Rebound. \n\nFrom UMD Offense:\n- 34 sequences lead to Rebound.\n- 14 sequences lead directly to Missed Shot and then to _Exit.\n- 21 sequences lead directly to _Exit.\n\nThe sequences that do not go to Rebound are those that go to Missed Shot (14) and those that go directly to _Exit (21).\n\n<reasoning>\n1. Identify the total number of sequences starting from UMD Offense: 34 + 14 + 21 = 69.\n2. Identify the number of sequences leading to Rebound: 34.\n3.
