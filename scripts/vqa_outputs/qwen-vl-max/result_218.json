  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "25",
  "llm_answer": "25",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The analysis involves tracing each pathway starting from \"UNC Offense\" nodes and counting the number of times \"Missed Shot\" occurs before reaching \"UMD Offense\". The first pathway shows 25 missed shots, while subsequent pathways do not show any missed shots before UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from \"UNC Offense\" nodes and count the occurrences of \"Missed Shot\" nodes before reaching any \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n1. Starting from the first \"UNC Offense\" node with 26 sequences:\n   - 25 sequences lead to a \"Missed Shot\".\n   - The remaining 1 sequence leads directly to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n2. Moving to the next \"UNC Offense\" node with 21 sequences:\n   - All 21 sequences lead to a \"Made Shot\", which does not involve a \"Missed Shot\".\n\n3. For the third \"UNC Offense\" node with 7 sequences:\n   - All 7 sequences lead to \"Turnover\", bypassing \"Missed Shot\".\n\nSummarizing these observations:\n- From the first \"UNC Offense\" node, there are 25 missed shots.\n- From the second and third \"UNC Offense\" nodes, there are no missed shots before reaching \"UMD Offense\".\n\nTherefore, the total number of missed shots occurring after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is 25.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe analysis involves tracing each pathway starting from \"UNC Offense\" nodes and counting the number of times \"Missed Shot\" occurs before reaching \"UMD Offense\". The first pathway shows 25 missed shots, while subsequent pathways do not show any missed shots before UMD Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>25</answer>",
