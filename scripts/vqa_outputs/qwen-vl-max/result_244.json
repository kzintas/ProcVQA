  "full_response": "To determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, I'll track all pathways starting with \"UNC Offense\" and ending with \"Made Shot\". \n\n1. Starting from the leftmost \"UNC Offense\":\n   - 2 sequences lead directly to a \"Made Shot\".\n   \n2. Moving right:\n   - 14 sequences go to \"Rebound\", then 5 of those lead to \"Made Shot\".\n   - 14 sequences go to \"Missed Shot\", then 10 of those lead to \"Made Free Throw\", which is not a made shot.\n   \n3. Further right:\n   - 12 sequences go to \"Foul\", none lead to a made shot.\n   - 14 sequences go to \"Steal\", none lead to a made shot.\n   - 9 sequences go to \"UMD Offense\", none lead to a made shot.\n\nSumming up the direct and indirect made shots:\n- Direct: 2\n- Indirect via Rebound: 5\n\n<reasoning>\nThe relevant pathways are those starting with \"UNC Offense\" and ending with \"Made Shot\".
