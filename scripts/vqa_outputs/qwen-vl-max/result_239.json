  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows multiple pathways starting from \"UNC Offense\". We track each pathway until it reaches \"UMD Offense\" and count the \"Missed Shot\" events in between. The relevant paths are:\n- Seventh \"UNC Offense\" leading to \"Missed Shot\" (9 sequences)\n- Tenth \"UNC Offense\" leading to \"Missed Shot\" (6 sequences)\nAdding these gives us the total number of missed shots.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from \"UNC Offense\" nodes to the first occurrence of \"UMD Offense\" and count the instances of \"Missed Shot\" along these paths.\n\n1. Starting from the leftmost \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Follows directly to \"_Exit\" (2 sequences).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n2. Second \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"Jump Ball\" (1 sequence).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n3. Third \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"Rebound\" (5 sequences).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n4. Fourth \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"Foul\" (9 sequences).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n5. Fifth \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"Steal\" (6 sequences).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n6. Sixth \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"UMD Offense\" (10 sequences).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n7. Seventh \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"Missed Shot\" (9 sequences).\n   - This is a direct path to \"UMD Offense\" (8 sequences).\n\n8. Eighth \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"Made Shot\" (17 sequences).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n9. Ninth \"UNC Offense\":\n   - Leads to \"Rebound\" (8 sequences).\n   - No \"Missed Shot\" here.\n\n10. Tenth \"UNC Offense\":\n    - Leads to \"Missed Shot\" (6 sequences).\n    - This is a direct path to \"UMD Offense\" (15 sequences).\n\nSumming up the \"Missed Shot\" occurrences:\n- 9 sequences from the seventh \"UNC Offense\"\n- 6 sequences from the tenth \"UNC Offense\"\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows multiple pathways starting from \"UNC Offense\".
