  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "64",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that from the \"Emergency\" node, 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\". Additionally, from the \"ICU\" node, 26 patients exit which can be interpreted as being discharged alive. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of these two numbers.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathways in the diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. \n\nFrom the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways:\n1. 62 patients go to the ICU.\n   - From the ICU, 36 patients die and 26 patients exit (presumably discharged).\n2. 38 patients directly go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nSumming these up:\n- Directly discharged from Emergency: 38 patients\n- Discharged after ICU: 26 patients\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that from the \"Emergency\" node, 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".
