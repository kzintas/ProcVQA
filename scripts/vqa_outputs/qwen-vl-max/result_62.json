Look for a link leading directly to the \"ICU\" node.\n3. Check the numeric label next to this link to find the count of sequences.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The \"Emergency\" node has two outgoing links.\n- One of these links points to the \"ICU\" node.\n- The numeric label next to this link is 62.\n\nThis indicates that 62 patients went from the Emergency to the ICU.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a clear pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"ICU\" node with a numeric label of 62 next to the link.
