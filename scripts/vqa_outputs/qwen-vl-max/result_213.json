  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows four pathways. By examining each pathway for nodes labeled \"Made Shot\", we find three such nodes with values 7, 4, and 16. Summing these values gives the total number of made shots.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, I'll identify all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" and sum their associated values:\n\n1. In the first pathway on the left:\n   - No \"Made Shot\" node is present.\n\n2. In the second pathway:\n   - One \"Made Shot\" node with a value of 7.\n\n3. In the third pathway:\n   - One \"Made Shot\" node with a value of 4.\n\n4. In the fourth pathway:\n   - One \"Made Shot\" node with a value of 16.\n\nSumming these values:\n\\[ 7 + 4 + 16 = 27 \\]\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows four pathways. By examining each pathway for nodes labeled \"Made Shot\", we find three such nodes with values 7, 4, and 16.
