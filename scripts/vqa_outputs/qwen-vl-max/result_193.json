  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"Start\" node, there are two main paths: one leading to \"Made Shot\" and another to \"Missed Shot\".\n2. The path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a count of 23.\n3. The path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 24.\n4. From \"Missed Shot\", there is a path directly to \"_Exit\" with a count of 24.\n5. Another path from \"Missed Shot\" leads to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 22.\n6. From \"UMD Offense\", there are two paths: one to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 and another to \"_Exit\" with a count of 22.\n7. Therefore, the total number of rebounds is the sum of the counts on the paths leading to \"Rebound\": 34.",
