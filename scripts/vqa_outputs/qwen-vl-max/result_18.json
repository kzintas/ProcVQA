  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two main pathways: one leading to \"ICU\" and another directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. The pathway to \"ICU\" has a count of 62.\n3. From \"ICU\", there are three further pathways:\n   - One leading to \"Die\" with a count of 36.\n   - Another leading to \"Floor\" with a count of 24.\n   - A third leading to \"_Exit\" with a count of 2 (this is not relevant for deaths).\n4. The pathway directly from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of 38 and does not involve any deaths.\n5. Summing up the counts of the pathways that lead to death gives us the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.",
