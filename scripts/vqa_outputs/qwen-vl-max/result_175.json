  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that after UMD Offense, there are two possible paths: one leading directly to an exit (35 sequences) and another leading to a Rebound (34 sequences). Since the question asks specifically about rebounds following UMD Offense, we focus on the path labeled 'Rebound' which has a numeric label of 34 next to it.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of rebounds made after UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from the \"UMD Offense\" node:\n\n1. From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two outgoing links:\n   - One leading directly to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.\n   - Another leading to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n\n2. The link to \"Rebound\" indicates that 34 sequences involve a rebound occurring after UMD Offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that after UMD Offense, there are two possible paths: one leading directly to an exit (35 sequences) and another leading to a Rebound (34 sequences).
