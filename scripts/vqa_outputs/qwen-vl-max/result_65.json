  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The visualization shows that all 100 patients arrive at Emergency. From Emergency, 62 patients proceed to ICU, and out of these, 36 die. Thus, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many patients died after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathways from \"Arrival\" through \"Emergency\" and then track which of these paths lead to death.\n\n1. All 100 patients start at \"Arrival\".\n2. From \"Arrival\", all 100 patients move to \"Emergency\".\n3. At \"Emergency\", there are two pathways:\n   - 62 patients go to \"ICU\".\n   - 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n4. Of the 62 patients who went to \"ICU\":\n   - 36 patients die.\n   - The remaining 36 patients (62 - 36) must have gone to \"Exit\" but this is not shown explicitly in the diagram.\n\n5. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of those who went through ICU and died: 36.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows that all 100 patients arrive at Emergency.
