  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "69",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n   - One link leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n   - Another link leads directly to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.\n\n2. The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense. In this context, we can interpret the counts next to the links as the number of sequences or events following that path.\n\n3. Summing these counts gives us the total number of sequences where UMD Offense either rebounded or exited after their offense:\n\n   34 (to Rebound) + 35 (to _Exit) = 69\n\nTherefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 69.",
