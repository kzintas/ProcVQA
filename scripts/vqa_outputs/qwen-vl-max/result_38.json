  "full_response": "To determine how many patients went to the ICU after Emergency, we need to follow the pathways from the \"Emergency\" node that lead to the \"ICU\" node.\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways:\n   - One pathway leads directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 38 patients.\n   - The other pathway leads to \"Floor\" with 41 patients.\n\n2. Of the 41 patients who went to \"Floor\", 21 then went to \"ICU\".\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency is 21.\n\n<reasoning>\nFrom the \"Emergency\" node, 41 patients go to \"Floor\".
