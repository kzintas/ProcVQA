  "llm_answer": "65",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The relevant pathways are those starting at \"UNC Offense\" and ending at \"Made Shot\". We sum the counts of direct paths (33 + 15) and the indirect path via \"Rebound\" (7).",
  "full_response": "To determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, we need to identify all pathways that start with \"UNC Offense\" and end with \"Made Shot\" without passing through any other \"UMD Offense\" nodes.\n\n1. Starting from the top left \"UNC Offense\" node:\n   - There are 19 sequences leading directly to a \"Rebound\".\n   - From this \"Rebound\", 7 sequences lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n\n2. Moving to the middle \"UNC Offense\" node:\n   - There are 33 sequences leading directly to a \"Made Shot\".\n\n3. Finally, for the top right \"UNC Offense\" node:\n   - All 15 sequences lead directly to a \"Made Shot\".\n\nSumming these up:\n- Directly from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\": 33 + 15 = 48\n- Indirect via \"Rebound\": 7\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of shots made by only the UNC offense.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe relevant pathways are those starting at \"UNC Offense\" and ending at \"Made Shot\". We sum the counts of direct paths (33 + 15) and the indirect path via \"Rebound\" (7).\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>65</answer>",
