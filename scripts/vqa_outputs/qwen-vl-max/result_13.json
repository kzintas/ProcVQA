  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to sum the counts on the pathways leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes.\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node:\n   - 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n2. From the \"ICU\" node:\n   - 24 patients go from ICU to \"Floor\".\n   - From \"Floor\", 24 patients are discharged alive.\n\nSumming these values:\n<reasoning>\n38 (directly from Emergency) + 24 (from Floor) = 62\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>62</answer>",
