  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that after \"UNC Offense,\" there's a split where one path goes directly to \"UMD Offense\" (23 sequences), and another path goes through \"Rebound.\" Of the sequences going through \"Rebound,\" 24 sequences result in a \"Missed Shot\" before proceeding to \"UMD Offense.\"",
  "full_response": "To determine how many missed shots occurred before UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from \"UNC Offense\" and count the number of sequences that lead to \"Missed Shot\" before reaching \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n1. From \"UNC Offense,\" there are two paths:\n   - One path leads directly to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 23.\n   - The other path leads to \"Rebound\" (15) and then splits into \"Made Shot\" (22) and \"Missed Shot\" (24).\n\n2. We are interested in the \"Missed Shot\" path:\n   - The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 24.\n\nTherefore, the number of missed shots before UMD Offense is 24.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that after \"UNC Offense,\" there's a split where one path goes directly to \"UMD Offense\" (23 sequences), and another path goes through \"Rebound.\" Of the sequences going through \"Rebound,\" 24 sequences result in a \"Missed Shot\" before proceeding to \"UMD Offense.\"\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
