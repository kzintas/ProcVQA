  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"Rebound\" node, there are two outgoing links: one leading to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15, and another leading to \"_Exit\" with a count of 19.\n2. The question asks specifically about shots made directly after a rebound, which corresponds to the path from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n3. Therefore, the number of shots made directly after a Rebound is the count on the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", which is 15.",
