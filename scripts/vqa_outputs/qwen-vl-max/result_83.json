  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "20",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The visualization shows a clear pathway from Arrival through Emergency, ICU, and Floor to Discharge-Alive. The number next to the link from Floor to Discharge-Alive indicates 20 sequences.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the pathway that starts with \"Arrival\" and leads through \"Emergency\", \"ICU\", and \"Floor\".\n2. Count the number of sequences at each step:\n   - From \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\": 24 sequences\n   - From \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\": 23 sequences\n   - From \"ICU\" to \"Floor\": 23 sequences\n3. Follow the path from \"Floor\":\n   - From \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\": 20 sequences\n\nThe total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the count at the \"Discharge-Alive\" node following the \"Floor\" node.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows a clear pathway from Arrival through Emergency, ICU, and Floor to Discharge-Alive. The number next to the link from Floor to Discharge-Alive indicates 20 sequences.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>20</answer>",
