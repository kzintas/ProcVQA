  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two main pathways: one leading to \"ICU\" and another directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. The pathway to \"ICU\" has 62 sequences.\n3. From \"ICU\", there are three further pathways:\n   - 36 sequences lead directly to \"Die\"\n   - 24 sequences go to \"Floor\"\n   - 2 sequences exit without reaching a terminal state.\n4. Of those going to \"Floor\", 24 sequences eventually reach \"Discharge-Alive\".\n5. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of those who went directly from ICU to Die (36) plus those who exited without reaching a terminal state (2).",
