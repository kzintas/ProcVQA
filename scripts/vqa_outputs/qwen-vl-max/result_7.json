  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to sum the counts of all pathways that lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node:\n   - 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n   \n2. From the \"ICU\" node:\n   - 24 patients go from ICU to \"Floor\", and then 24 of those go to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nSumming these values:\n\\[ 38 + 24 = 62 \\]\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows two pathways leading to \"Discharge-Alive\":\n1.
