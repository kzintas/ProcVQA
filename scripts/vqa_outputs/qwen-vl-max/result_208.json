  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "By tracing the pathways from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\", we find two distinct paths with counts 13 and 8. Summing these gives the total number of made free throws by UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense, I'll follow the pathways starting from \"UMD Offense\" nodes and look for links leading to \"Made Free Throw\".\n\n1. Starting from the first \"UMD Offense\" node at the top:\n   - There is a link to \"Foul\" with a count of 3.\n   - From \"Foul\", there are two paths: one to \"Made Free Throw\" (count 13) and another back to \"UMD Offense\" (count 8).\n\n2. The second \"UMD Offense\" node in the middle:\n   - Directly leads to \"Made Free Throw\" with a count of 8.\n\nSumming up the counts from these pathways:\n- First path: 13\n- Second path: 8\n\n<reasoning>By tracing the pathways from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\", we find two distinct paths with counts 13 and 8. Summing these gives the total number of made free throws by UMD Offense.</reasoning>\n\n<answer>21</answer>",
