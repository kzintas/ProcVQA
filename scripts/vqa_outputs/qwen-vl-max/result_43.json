From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n   - One link leads directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a count of 38.\n   - The other link leads to \"Floor\" with a count of 21.\n\n2. We are interested in the direct path to \"Discharge-Alive,\" which is the link with a count of 38.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that from the \"Emergency\" node, 38 patients proceed directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" without any intermediate steps.
