From \"Emergency\", identify paths leading to \"Die _Exit\":\n   - The path from \"Emergency\" (count 12) leads directly to \"Die _Exit\" (count 12).\n   - The path from \"Emergency\" (count 37) leads to \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\" (count 37), not \"Die _Exit\".\n   - The path from \"Emergency\" (count 24) leads to \"ICU\" (count 23), then \"Floor\" (count 23), and finally \"Die _Exit\" (count 18).\n   - The path from \"Emergency\" (count 27) leads to \"ICU\" (count 24), then \"Floor\" (count 27), and finally \"Die _Exit\" (count 27).\n4.
