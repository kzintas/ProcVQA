  "question": "How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "7",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. From \"UMD Offense\", there are three main paths:\n   - Directly to \"_Exit\" (27 sequences)\n   - To \"Missed Shot\" (16 sequences)\n   - To \"Foul\" (7 sequences)\n\n2. The path to \"Missed Shot\" further branches:\n   - Directly to \"_Exit\" (9 sequences)\n   - To \"Rebound\" (7 sequences)\n\n3. The path to \"Foul\" also branches:\n   - Directly to \"_Exit\" (7 sequences)\n\n4. Summarizing the rebounds:\n   - 7 sequences from \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Missed Shot\" -> \"Rebound\"\n\nTherefore, the total number of rebounds made after UMD Offense is 7.",
