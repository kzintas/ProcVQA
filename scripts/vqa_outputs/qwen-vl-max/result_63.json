There is no direct link from \"ICU\" to \"Floor\". The question asks about patients going to the Floor after the ICU, but the diagram does not show this pathway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given visualization, it is not possible to determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU because this specific path is not depicted.",
