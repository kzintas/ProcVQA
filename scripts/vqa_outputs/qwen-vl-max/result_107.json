  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows four different pathways starting from arrival. By tracing each path, we find two paths leading to discharge-alive:\n1. Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive (37)\n2. Arrival (24) -> Emergency (24) -> ICU (23) -> Floor (23) -> Discharge-Alive (20)\nSumming these values gives us the total number of patients discharged alive.",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, I'll follow the pathways that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. \n\n1. Starting from the top, there are 4 distinct pathways originating from the \"Arrival\" nodes.\n2. The first pathway on the far left shows:\n   - Arrival (12) -> Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die (12)\n3. The second pathway shows:\n   - Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive (37)\n4. The third pathway shows:\n   - Arrival (24) -> Emergency (24) -> ICU (23) -> Floor (23) -> Discharge-Alive (20)\n5. The fourth pathway shows:\n   - Arrival (27) -> Emergency (27) -> ICU (24) -> Die (18)\n\nFrom these pathways, only the second and third pathways lead to discharge-alive outcomes. Summing up the counts for these pathways:\n\n- Second pathway: 37\n- Third pathway: 20\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows four different pathways starting from arrival. By tracing each path, we find two paths leading to discharge-alive:\n1. Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive (37)\n2.
