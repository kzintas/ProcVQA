  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows a clear pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" and then splits into two paths: one leading to \"ICU\" and another directly to \"Discharge-Alive\". The specific count of patients moving from \"ICU\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 26.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathways from \"Arrival\" through \"Emergency\" and then identify the path leading to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n1. All 100 patients start at \"Arrival\".\n2. From \"Arrival\", all 100 patients move to \"Emergency\".\n3. At \"Emergency\", 62 patients go to \"ICU\" and 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nSince the question asks for patients who were discharged alive after going to the floor (which is represented by \"ICU\"), we focus on the pathway that leads from \"ICU\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\n4. From \"ICU\", 26 patients proceed to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThus, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the ICU is 26.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a clear pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" and then splits into two paths: one leading to \"ICU\" and another directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".
