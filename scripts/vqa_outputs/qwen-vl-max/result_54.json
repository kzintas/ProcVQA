  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathways that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes.\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node:\n   - 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n   \n2. From the \"ICU\" node:\n   - 24 patients go to \"Floor\" and then to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nAdding these numbers together gives us the total number of patients discharged alive:\n\n<reasoning>\n- Direct path from Emergency to Discharge-Alive: 38 patients\n- Path from Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive: 24 patients\n- Total = 38 + 24 = 62 patients\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>62</answer>",
