  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The \"Floor\" node has two outgoing links: one to \"Discharge-Alive\" and one to \"ICU\".\n- The link from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" is labeled with the number 24.\n- This indicates that 24 sequences follow the path from Floor to ICU.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many patients went to the ICU after the Floor, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the node labeled \"Floor\" and trace its outgoing links.\n2. Look for a link leading to the \"ICU\" node.\n3. Check the numeric label next to this link to find the count of sequences.\n\n<reasoning>\n- The \"Floor\" node has two outgoing links: one to \"Discharge-Alive\" and one to \"ICU\".\n- The link from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" is labeled with the number 24.\n- This indicates that 24 sequences follow the path from Floor to ICU.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
