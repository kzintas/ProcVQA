  "reasoning": "The visualization shows a direct link from the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"Jump Ball\" node with a numeric label of 1. This means there was exactly one sequence where a jump ball followed an UNC Offense.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the node labeled \"UNC Offense\" and trace its outgoing links.\n2. Look for a link leading to a node labeled \"Jump Ball\".\n3. Check the numeric label next to this link to find the count.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n- The \"UNC Offense\" node has multiple outgoing links.\n- One of these links leads directly to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n- The numeric label next to this link is 1.\n\nThis indicates that a jump ball occurred once immediately following an UNC Offense event.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows a direct link from the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"Jump Ball\" node with a numeric label of 1. This means there was exactly one sequence where a jump ball followed an UNC Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
