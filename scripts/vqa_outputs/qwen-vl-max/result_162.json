  "true_answer": "60",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows direct and indirect pathways from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\" By summing the counts on the links leading to \"UMD Offense,\" we find a total of 8 transitions.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to trace the pathways leading from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\" \n\n1. From \"UNC Offense,\" there are multiple paths:\n   - 23 sequences lead to \"Rebound.\"\n   - 8 sequences lead to \"Foul.\"\n   - 4 sequences lead directly to \"Made Shot.\"\n\n2. From \"Rebound\":\n   - 4 sequences lead to \"Made Shot.\"\n   - 9 sequences lead to \"Missed Shot.\"\n   - 15 sequences lead back to \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n3. From \"Foul\":\n   - 5 sequences lead to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n   - 5 sequences lead to \"Turnover.\"\n   - 5 sequences lead back to \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n4. From \"Made Shot\":\n   - 4 sequences lead to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\nSumming up all the transitions that lead to \"UMD Offense\" from \"UNC Offense\":\n- Directly from \"UNC Offense\": 4\n- Indirectly via \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\": 4\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows direct and indirect pathways from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\" By summing the counts on the links leading to \"UMD Offense,\" we find a total of 8 transitions.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>8</answer>",
