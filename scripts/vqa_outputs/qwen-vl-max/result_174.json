From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are several pathways:\n   - 27 sequences lead directly to \"_Exit\".\n   - 8 sequences lead to \"Made Shot\".\n   - 16 sequences lead to \"Missed Shot\".\n   - 7 sequences lead to \"Foul\".\n\n2.

There is no direct link or pathway from \"UMD Offense\" to any node labeled as \"Steal\".\n\nGiven this analysis, there are no sequences in the diagram where a steal occurs immediately following UMD Offense.",
