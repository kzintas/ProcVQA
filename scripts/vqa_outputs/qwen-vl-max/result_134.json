  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From \"UMD Offense\", there are three pathways:\n   - 34 sequences go to \"Rebound\"\n   - 14 sequences go directly to \"Missed Shot\" and exit\n   - 21 sequences go directly to \"Missed Shot\" and exit\n\n2. For the \"Rebound\" pathway:\n   - 15 sequences result in a \"Made Shot\" and exit\n   - 19 sequences exit without a made shot\n\n3. The only path leading to a \"Made Shot\" is the one with 15 sequences from \"Rebound\".\n\nTherefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is 15.",
