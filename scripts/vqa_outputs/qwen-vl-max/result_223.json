  "llm_answer": "20",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- The first \"UNC Offense\" node has a direct link to \"Made Shot\" with a value of 20.\n- No other pathways from \"UNC Offense\" nodes lead directly to \"Made Shot\".",
  "full_response": "To determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, I'll track all pathways starting from \"UNC Offense\" and ending at \"Made Shot\". \n\n1. Starting from the first \"UNC Offense\":\n   - 26 sequences lead to a \"Missed Shot\"\n   - 20 sequences lead directly to a \"Made Shot\"\n\n2. From the second \"UNC Offense\":\n   - 21 sequences lead to a \"Turnover\", which doesn't result in a shot\n   - 7 sequences lead to a \"UMD Offense\", which also doesn't count as a made shot for UNC\n\n3. From the third \"UNC Offense\":\n   - 7 sequences lead to a \"UMD Offense\", again not resulting in a made shot for UNC\n\nSumming up the direct made shots from the first \"UNC Offense\":\n<reasoning>\n- The first \"UNC Offense\" node has a direct link to \"Made Shot\" with a value of 20.\n- No other pathways from \"UNC Offense\" nodes lead directly to \"Made Shot\".\n</reasoning> \n<answer>20</answer>",
