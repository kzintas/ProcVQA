  "full_response": "To determine how many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathways from the \"UMD Offense\" node. \n\n- There are two pathways leading directly from \"UMD Offense\":\n  - One pathway leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n  - The other pathway leads to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n\nSince the question asks for shots missed immediately after UMD Offense, we focus on the pathway leading to \"Missed Shot\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that there is a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" with a numeric label of 14. This indicates that 14 sequences involve a missed shot immediately following UMD Offense.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>14</answer>",
