  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two main paths: one leading to \"ICU\" and another directly to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. The path to \"ICU\" has 62 sequences.\n3. From \"ICU\", there are three further paths:\n   - 36 sequences lead to \"Die\"\n   - 24 sequences lead to \"Floor\"\n   - 2 sequences exit without further details.\n4. The path from \"Floor\" leads to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 24 sequences.\n5. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of those who went through ICU and then died.",
