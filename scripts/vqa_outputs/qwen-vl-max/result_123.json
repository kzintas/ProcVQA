  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "32",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that from UMD Offense, there are four possible transitions: Rebound (34), Missed Shot (14), Foul (10), and Made Shot (8). The total number of sequences from UMD Offense is 66. Since 34 sequences go to Rebound, the remaining sequences that do not go to Rebound are calculated by subtracting 34 from 66.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to identify all the pathways from UMD Offense that do not lead to Rebound. \n\nFrom the node \"UMD Offense,\" there are four outgoing links:\n1. To \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n2. To \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n3. To \"Foul\" with a count of 10.\n4. To \"Made Shot\" with a count of 8.\n\nThe total number of sequences starting from UMD Offense is the sum of these counts: \n\\[ 34 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 66 \\]\n\nThe number of sequences that transition to Rebound is 34. Therefore, the number of sequences that do not transition to Rebound is:\n\\[ 66 - 34 = 32 \\]\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that from UMD Offense, there are four possible transitions: Rebound (34), Missed Shot (14), Foul (10), and Made Shot (8).
