From the \"Floor\" node after ICU:\n   - 24 patients go from ICU to Floor and then to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nAdding these together:\n\n<reasoning>\nThe total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of those who went directly from Emergency to Discharge-Alive (38) and those who went through ICU and Floor before being discharged alive (24).\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>62</answer>",
