  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that from the \"Rebound\" node, there is a direct path to \"Made Shot\" with a numeric label of 15. This indicates that 15 sequences involve a shot being made directly after a rebound.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many shots were made directly after a Rebound, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Rebound\" node to the \"Made Shot\" node. \n\n1. From the \"Rebound\" node, there are three outgoing links:\n   - One link leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n   - Another link leads to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 9.\n   - The third link leads to \"_Exit\" with a count of 10.\n\n2. We are interested in the link that goes directly to \"Made Shot\". This link has a count of 15.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that from the \"Rebound\" node, there is a direct path to \"Made Shot\" with a numeric label of 15. This indicates that 15 sequences involve a shot being made directly after a rebound.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
