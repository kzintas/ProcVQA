  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows that from the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are three pathways. One of these pathways leads to the \"Rebound\" node with a numeric label of 34. This indicates that 34 sequences followed the path from UMD Offense to Rebound.",
  "full_response": "To determine the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the node labeled \"UMD Offense\" and trace its outgoing links.\n2. Look for a link leading to a node labeled \"Rebound\".\n3. Check the numeric label next to this link to find the count.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The node \"UMD Offense\" has three outgoing links.\n- One of these links leads to the node \"Rebound\".\n- The numeric label next to this link is 34.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe node-link diagram shows that from the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are three pathways.
