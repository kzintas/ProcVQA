  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows a direct path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 22. Following this, there's a path from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 24. Since we're interested in sequences where \"Made Shot\" is immediately followed by \"UMD Offense,\" we consider the count on the link directly connecting these two nodes, which is 24.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense, we need to follow the pathways in the diagram:\n\n1. Identify the node labeled \"UNC Offense.\"\n2. Trace the paths originating from this node.\n3. Look for a path that leads to \"Made Shot\" and then continues to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- There are two paths from \"UNC Offense\":\n  - One directly to \"Rebound\" (not relevant here).\n  - Another to \"Made Shot\" with a link count of 22.\n\nFollowing this path:\n- From \"Made Shot,\" there is a direct link to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 24.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we're counting only those sequences where \"Made Shot\" is followed by \"UMD Offense.\" The link count between \"Made Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" is 24, which represents the number of sequences following this specific path.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows a direct path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 22. Following this, there's a path from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 24.
