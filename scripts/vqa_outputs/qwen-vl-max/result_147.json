  "reasoning": "The diagram shows two paths from UMD Offense: one to Rebound (34 sequences) and one directly to _Exit (35 sequences). The question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did not lead to Rebound, which is represented by the path directly to _Exit. Therefore, the count on this link, 35, is the answer.",
  "full_response": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to examine the pathways from UMD Offense. \n\n1. There are two outgoing links from UMD Offense:\n   - One link leads to Rebound with a count of 34.\n   - The other link leads directly to _Exit with a count of 35.\n\n2. The question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to Rebound. This corresponds to the pathway leading directly to _Exit.\n\n3. The count on the link from UMD Offense to _Exit is 35.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows two paths from UMD Offense: one to Rebound (34 sequences) and one directly to _Exit (35 sequences).
