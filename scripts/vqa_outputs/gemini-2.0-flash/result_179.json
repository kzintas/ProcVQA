  "true_answer": "49",
  "llm_answer": "49",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of rebounds in the match. The node-link diagram shows two \"Rebound\" nodes, one after \"UNC Offense\" and one after \"UMD Offense\". The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of 15, and the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of 34. Summing those values (15+34) gives a total of 49 rebounds.",
  "full_response": "1. The question asks about the total number of rebounds in the match.\n2. There are two \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram.\n3. The \"UNC Offense\" node connects to the first \"Rebound\" node with a count of 15.\n4. The \"UMD Offense\" node connects to the second \"Rebound\" node with a count of 34.\n5. Adding these two numbers together would give the total number of rebounds.\n6. Therefore, 15 + 34 = 49.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the total number of rebounds in the match.
