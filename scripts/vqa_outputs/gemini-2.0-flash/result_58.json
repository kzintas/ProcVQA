  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "48",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients who were discharged alive AFTER going to the Floor. I need to trace the paths from the Floor node to the Discharge-Alive node and sum up the link values for these paths.\nThere are two paths from Floor to Discharge-Alive. One that goes Floor -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive (24 + 24 = 48), and another that goes Emergency -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive (24). Therefore, the total number is 24 + 24 = 48.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the nodes of interest:** We need to find all paths leading to 'Discharge-Alive' nodes from the 'Floor' node.\n2.  **Trace pathways and count:**\n    *   One path goes from 'Floor' to 'ICU' to 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'. The link from 'Floor' to 'ICU' has a value of 21, and the link from 'ICU' to 'Floor' has a value of 24, and then the link from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive' has a value of 24. Therefore, 24 patients were discharged alive after this path.\n    *   Another path goes directly from 'Emergency' to 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive', so the link from 'Emergency' to 'Floor' has a value of 21. The link from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive' has a value of 24. This means 24 patients were discharged alive on this path.\n    *   A path also goes from 'Emergency' to 'Discharge-Alive'. 38 patients followed this path. But, it does not involve 'Floor'.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total:** The total number of patients discharged alive after visiting the floor is 24 + 24 = 48\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the total number of patients who were discharged alive AFTER going to the Floor.
