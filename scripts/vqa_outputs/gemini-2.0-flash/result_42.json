  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The visualization shows two \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes. One is directly linked to \"Emergency\" with a value of 38. The other \"Discharge-Alive\" node is reached via the path: \"Emergency\" -> \"Floor\" -> \"ICU\" -> \"Floor\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\", the link between the last two nodes (\"Floor\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\") has a value of 24. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38 + 24 = 62.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** I need to find the nodes representing \"Discharge-Alive\" and the number of patients associated with each path leading to it.\n2.  **Trace the paths:**\n    *   From \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\": 38 patients\n    *   From \"ICU\" to \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\": 24 patients\n3.  **Calculate the total:** I add the number of patients from each path to find the total number of patients discharged alive.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe visualization shows two \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes.
