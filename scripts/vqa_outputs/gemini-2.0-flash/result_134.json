  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question is asking for the total number of made shots after a UMD offense. The diagram shows sequences of events and the number of times those events occurred. After UMD Offense, the sequence goes to Rebound -> Made Shot -> _Exit. There are 15 sequences for Rebound -> Made Shot. Therefore, there are 15 Made Shots by UMD offense. However, without information about other possible \"Made Shot\" outcomes that are not presented within this sub-sequence, we are unable to calculate the total number of shots made by UMD offense. Thus the number must be 15.",
  "full_response": "1. The question asks for the total number of shots made by the UMD offense.\n2. From the diagram, the sequences start from \"_Start\" followed by \"UNC Offense\" and then \"UMD Offense\".\n3. After \"UMD Offense\", there are three possible paths: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n4. The \"Rebound\" node has a path to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n5. Therefore, the number of made shots after \"UMD Offense\" is 15.\n6. However, it is possible that there are other shot outcomes (made shots) within the offense which are not explictly represented by the available nodes. Thus, with only the given visualization we cannot be certain of the total made shots.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question is asking for the total number of made shots after a UMD offense.
