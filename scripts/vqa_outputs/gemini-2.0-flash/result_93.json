  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks about the total number of patients discharged alive.\n2.  I located the two nodes labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the visualization.\n3.  One \"Discharge-Alive\" node is connected to the \"Emergency\" node with a link value of 37.\n4. The other \"Discharge-Alive\" node is connected to the \"Floor\" node with a link value of 20.\n5.  I summed these two values to get the total number of discharged patients. 37 + 20 = 57",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant nodes and links:** The question asks about patients who were \"Discharged-Alive\". I need to find the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" and examine the links connected to it to determine the number of patients.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Discharge-Alive\" node:**\n    *   There's one node labelled \"Discharge-Alive\" with a value of 37 connecting to \"Emergency\".\n    * There is another node labelled \"Discharge-Alive\" with a value of 20 connecting to \"Floor\".\n\n3.  **Sum the values:** To find the total number of patients discharged alive, I need to sum the counts associated with links arriving at the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes. In this case, that's 37 + 20 = 57\n\n```xml\n<reasoning>\n1.  The question asks about the total number of patients discharged alive.\n2.
