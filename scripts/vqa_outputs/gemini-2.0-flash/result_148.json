  "reasoning": "The question asks how many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense. The diagram shows that the sequences split from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" (34) and to \"_Exit\" (35). Shots are missed when the sequence goes to \"Rebound\". Therefore the number of shots missed after UMD Offense is 34.",
