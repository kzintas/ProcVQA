To find the total shots made by UMD offense, I need to look at the paths originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n3.  From \"UMD Offense\", there are two outgoing paths: one to \"Rebound\" with a value of 34, and another to \"_Exit\" with a value of 35.\n4.  The total number of shots made by UMD offense is the sum of these two paths: 34 + 35 = 69.\n\n<answer>69</answer>",
