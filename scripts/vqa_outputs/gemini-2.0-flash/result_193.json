From the diagram, the link connecting 'UMD Offense' to 'Rebound' has a value of 34. The link connecting 'Rebound' to '_Exit' has a value of 24. However, only the link connecting 'UMD Offense' to 'Rebound' indicates a rebound event. The link connecting 'Rebound' to '_Exit' represents events after a rebound.\n4. Therefore, the total number of rebounds is 34.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the number of rebounds. The diagram shows a node labeled 'Rebound'.
