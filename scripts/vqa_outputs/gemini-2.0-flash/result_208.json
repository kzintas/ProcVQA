  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question explicitly asks for the number of made free throws that lead into a UMD Offense event. I need to find the nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\" and then examine the links that connect from those nodes into \"UMD Offense\" nodes. In the visualization, there are two \"Made Free Throw\" nodes with counts 13 and 8. The \"Made Free Throw\" node with count 8 leads directly to a \"UMD Offense\" node with a count of 8. The \"Made Free Throw\" node with count 13 does not directly link to UMD Offense. Therefore, the answer is 8.",
