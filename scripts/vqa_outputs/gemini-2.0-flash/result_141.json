  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occurred directly after a \"Rebound\" event. The node-link diagram visualizes sequences of events, with nodes representing events and directed links representing transitions between them. The numbers next to the links represent the number of times that specific transition occurred.\nI located the node \"Rebound\".\nI found the link that goes from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\". The number next to this link is \"15\".\nTherefore, 15 \"Made Shot\" events occurred directly after a \"Rebound\" event.",
  "full_response": "1. The question asks about the number of \"Made Shots\" that occurred directly after a \"Rebound\".\n2. I need to identify the node labeled \"Rebound\" and then find the outgoing link that leads to the node labeled \"Made Shot\".\n3. I see that the link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a number \"15\" associated with it.\n4. Therefore, 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occurred directly after a \"Rebound\" event.
