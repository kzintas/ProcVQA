The question is about \"free throws made by UMD Offense\".\n2. I need to identify all \"Made Free Throw\" nodes.\n3.  There are two \"Made Free Throw\" nodes. The first one is associated with 13 free throws. The second one is associated with 8 free throws.\n4. I need to identify which, if any, of the \"Made Free Throw\" nodes is preceded by a \"UMD Offense\" node.\n5. The \"Made Free Throw\" node with value 8 is preceded by a \"UMD Offense\" node with value 8.\n6. Therefore, there are 8 free throws made from UMD Offense.\n</reasoning>\n```\n<answer>8</answer>",
