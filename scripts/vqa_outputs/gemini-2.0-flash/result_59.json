  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency. I need to trace the paths starting from the 'Emergency' node and see how many end up at the 'Die' node. From 'Emergency', 62 patients went to 'ICU', and from 'ICU', 36 patients went to 'Die'. From 'Die', 36 patients reached '_Exit'. So, 36 patients died after arriving at the emergency.",
  "full_response": "1. **Identify the nodes and links:**\n   - We need to track the path: Emergency -> ICU -> Die -> _Exit.\n   - The link between Emergency and ICU has a count of 62.\n   - The link between ICU and Die has a count of 36.\n   - The link between Die and _Exit has a count of 36.\n\n2. **Follow the path and count:**\n   - Starting from Emergency, 62 patients went to ICU.\n   - From ICU, 36 patients died.\n   - Thus, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency and going to ICU.\n\n3. **Formulate the answer:**\n   - Based on the diagram, 36 patients died after the Emergency and ICU event sequence.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.
