  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. The question is about \"free throws made by UMD Offense\".\n2. I need to identify all \"Made Free Throw\" nodes.\n3.  There are two \"Made Free Throw\" nodes. The first one is associated with 13 free throws. The second one is associated with 8 free throws.\n4. I need to identify which, if any, of the \"Made Free Throw\" nodes is preceded by a \"UMD Offense\" node.\n5. The \"Made Free Throw\" node with value 8 is preceded by a \"UMD Offense\" node with value 8.\n6. Therefore, there are 8 free throws made from UMD Offense.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant nodes:** The question asks about \"free throws made by UMD Offense\". Thus, I need to find a \"Made Free Throw\" node, and check which UMD Offense lead to that Made Free Throw.\n2.  **Trace pathways and count:** I find two \"Made Free Throw\" nodes. One of them is preceded by a \"Foul\" node with weight 15, which is in turn preceded by \"UNC Offense\". The other \"Made Free Throw\" node (with weight 8) is preceded by a \"UMD Offense\" node (also with weight 8).\n3.  **Provide the answer**: From the visualization, I see that there are 8 free throws made from UMD Offense.\n\n```xml\n<reasoning>\n1.
