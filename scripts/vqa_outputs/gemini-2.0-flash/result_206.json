  "full_response": "1. Identify relevant nodes: I need to find all the nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" and their associated sequence counts.\n2. Extract counts: The visualization shows two \"Made Shot\" nodes.\n    - One \"Made Shot\" node has a count of 7.\n    - The other \"Made Shot\" node has a count of 21.\n3. Calculate total: To find the total number of made shots, I need to add these counts together.\n    - Total = 7 + 21 = 28\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the total number of made shots.\nI identified two \"Made Shot\" nodes with associated counts of 7 and 21 respectively.\nI summed these counts to get the total number of made shots.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>28</answer>",
