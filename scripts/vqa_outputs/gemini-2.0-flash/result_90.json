  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. The question asks about the number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n2. I need to identify paths in the diagram that start at the 'Floor' node and eventually lead to a 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n3. Upon examining the diagram, I find a 'Floor' node in the fourth column.\n4. This node connects to 'ICU'.\n5. I can not find paths originating from the 'Floor' node and ending at a 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n6. Therefore, the number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 0.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the nodes and links of interest:**\n    *   We are looking for patients who were discharged alive after being on the Floor. This means we need to find pathways that include the \"Floor\" node and then lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\n2.  **Examine the pathways:**\n    *   Starting from the \"Floor\" node on the fourth column of the diagram. Then to \"ICU\" with a count of 24\n    *   There is no pathway that goes from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n```xml\n<reasoning>\n1.
