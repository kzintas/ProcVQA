  "full_response": "1.  The question asks about the number of patients discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n2.  I need to identify pathways where the sequence is \"Emergency\" followed directly by \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3.  There is a pathway: \"_Start, Arrival, Emergency, Discharge-Alive_Exit\" with 37 patients.\n\n4.  However, this path contains one more step, from \"_Start, Arrival\" to \"Emergency\". To only consider path \"Emergency\" followed directly by \"Discharge-Alive\", there is no such explicit path in the visualization. Thus, the answer is indeterminate.\n\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
