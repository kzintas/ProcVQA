  "reasoning": "1.  The question asks the total number of rebounds.\n2.  Find the nodes labeled 'Rebound' and note their sequence counts.\n3.  The first 'Rebound' node has a count of 26.\n4.  The second 'Rebound' node has a count of 17.\n5.  Calculate the total: 26 + 17 = 43",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant elements:** The diagram shows two instances of \"Rebound\" nodes. I need to find the values associated with the links connected to those nodes to determine the number of rebounds.\n2.  **Analyze the diagram:**\n    *   The first \"Rebound\" node has a value of 26.\n    *   The second \"Rebound\" node has a value of 17.\n3.  **Calculate the total rebounds:** Add the values from both rebound nodes to find the total number of rebounds. 26 + 17 = 43\n\n```xml\n<reasoning>\n1.
