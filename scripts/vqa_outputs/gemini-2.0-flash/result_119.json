  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "16",
  "llm_answer": "14",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. The question asks about the number of \"Foul\" events occurring specifically after \"UMD Offense\".\n2. I need to identify all paths that lead from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" and sum the counts on those links.\n3. Starting from \"UMD Offense\", there is a link directly to \"Foul\" with a count of 8.\n4. \"UMD Offense\" also leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 and \"Rebound\" leads to \"Foul\" with a count of 6.\n5. Therefore the total Fouls made after UMD Offense is 8+6=14.",
  "full_response": "1. The question asks about the total number of fouls made by UMD Offense.\n2. I will trace the \"UMD Offense\" node to find the links that lead to \"Foul\".\n3. I found two links that lead to \"Foul\": one with a value of 10, and one with a value of 6 from \"Rebound\" to \"Foul\".\n4. The first link starts from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" with a value of 8, and the other link is \"Rebound\" to \"Foul\" with a value of 6. \n5. It must be the sum of both links. That is, 8+6=14.\n\n<reasoning>\n1. The question asks about the number of \"Foul\" events occurring specifically after \"UMD Offense\".\n2.
