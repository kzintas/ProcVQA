  "true_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": "10",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks the total number of free throws made. Looking at the graph, I can identify two nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\". The first \"Made Free Throw\" node has an incoming edge from a \"Foul\" node with the value of 6. The second \"Made Free Throw\" node has an incoming edge from a \"Foul\" node with the value of 4. Summing these two values gives 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, the total number of made free throws is 10.",
