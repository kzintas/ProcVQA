  "full_response": " The question asks about patients discharged alive *after* going to the Floor.\n1.  I need to identify the \"Floor\" node and check for any paths leading to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2.  I locate the 'Floor' node. I see one path from 'Floor' to 'ICU' which has a count of 23. I also see one path from 'ICU' to 'Die'.\n3.  There is a 'Discharge-Alive' node. However, I don't find any path from floor to Discharge-Alive in any of the columns.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeterminate\n\n",
