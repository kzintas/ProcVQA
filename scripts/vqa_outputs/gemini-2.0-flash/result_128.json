  "full_response": "1.  Identify the relevant node: I need to find the \"Made Shot\" node that follows \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  Trace the path: The \"UMD Offense\" node splits into multiple paths. One of these paths leads directly to a \"Made Shot\" node. The number associated with this link is 8.\n3. From the rebound node we have another \"Made Shot\" node. The number associated with this link is 15.\n4. Calculate the total free throws: 8 + 15 = 23\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the total number of made free throws from UMD Offense.\nI need to trace the paths from UMD Offense that end with 'Made Shot' and sum the counts on those paths.\nUMD Offense -> Made Shot -> _Exit has a count of 8.\nUMD Offense -> Rebound -> Made Shot -> _Exit has a count of 34 -> 15.\nTherefore, the total number of made free throws made by UMD offense is 8 + 15 = 23.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>23</answer>",
