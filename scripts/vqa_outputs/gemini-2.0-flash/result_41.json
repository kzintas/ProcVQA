  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant nodes and links:**\n    *   Start node: 'Emergency'\n    *   Target node: 'Die'\n    *   Links: Need to trace the path from 'Emergency' to 'Die'\n2.  **Trace the path:**\n    *   From 'Emergency', we see two paths: one to 'Floor' (count 41) and one to 'Discharge-Alive' (count 38)\n    *   From 'Floor', one goes to 'ICU' (count 21)\n    *   From 'ICU', one goes to 'Die' (count 36)\n3.  **Calculate the number of patients:**\n    *   The path to 'Die' goes through 'Emergency' -> 'Floor' -> 'ICU' -> 'Die' with counts 41 -> 21 -> 36. Therefore, there are 36 patients who died after going to Emergency.\n\n**Answer:**\n36\n",
