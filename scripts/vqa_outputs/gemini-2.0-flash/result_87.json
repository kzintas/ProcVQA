  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant elements:**\n    -   I need to find a path that starts with \"Emergency\" and directly goes to \"Discharge-Alive\\_Exit\".\n    -   I need to find the number associated with the link connecting \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\\_Exit\".\n\n2.  **Describe the thought process:**\n    -   Scan the diagram for an \"Emergency\" node.\n    -   Check if there is a direct link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\\_Exit\".\n    -   Note the value associated with the link.\n    -   If there is no such direct link, the answer is 0.\n\n3.  **Calculations:**\n    -   Starting from the left, the first \"Emergency\" has a value of 12. However, it goes to ICU.\n    -   The second \"Emergency\" has a value of 37. It goes directly to \"Discharge-Alive\\_Exit\" with a value of 37.\n    -   The third \"Emergency\" has a value of 24. It goes to ICU.\n    -   The fourth \"Emergency\" has a value of 27. It goes to Floor.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:**\n    -   37 patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n\n<answer>37</answer>",
