  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. I need to identify all the paths that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, and then add up the number of patients that follow those paths to the \"_Exit\" node.\nThe first path is \"Emergency\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\" -> \"_Exit\", which has 38 patients.\nThe second path is \"ICU\" -> \"Floor\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\" -> \"_Exit\", which has 24 patients.\nThe total number of patients discharged alive is 38 + 24 = 62.",
