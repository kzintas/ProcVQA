  "full_response": "1. The question asks about the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.\n2. I need to identify the path that starts with \"Emergency\" and ends with \"Die\".\n3. I will examine each column separately.\n4. In the first column, 12 patients started at \"_Start\", went through \"Arrival\", \"Emergency\", and \"ICU\", eventually \"Die _Exit\". Thus, 12 patients died after Emergency in this path.\n5. In the fourth column, 18 patients died after arriving at Emergency. However, before dying, they went to the \"Floor\" and \"ICU\".\n6. Therefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 12 + 18 = 30.\n\n<answer>30</answer>",
