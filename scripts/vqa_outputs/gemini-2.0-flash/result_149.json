  "full_response": "1. The question asks about the number of shots made after a Rebound. In this diagram, the \"_Exit\" node following the \"Rebound\" node represents a shot.\n2. The link between \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\" has a numeric label, which represents the count of sequences following that path.\n3. The count label for the link from \"Rebound\" to \"_Exit\" is 34.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question is \"How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?\".\nThe diagram shows that the \"Rebound\" node is directly connected to the \"_Exit\" node, and the link connecting these two nodes is labeled with \"34\".\nTherefore, the number of shots made directly after a Rebound is 34.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>34</answer>",
