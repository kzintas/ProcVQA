  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of shots made after a rebound, which implies the end state. I identified the \"Rebound\" node and its outgoing link to the \"_Exit\" node. This link has a value of 34. Thus, 34 shots were made directly after a rebound.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the node representing \"Rebound\"**: Locate the node labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n2.  **Identify the outgoing links from \"Rebound\"**: Find all directed links originating from the \"Rebound\" node.\n3.  **Identify the target nodes of these links**: Determine the nodes that these links point to.\n4.  **Read the numeric labels of these links**: Extract the numeric values associated with the links.\n5.  **Sum the counts**: Sum the values to get the number of shots made directly after a \"Rebound\"\n\nThe node \"Rebound\" has only one outgoing link that goes to \"_Exit\" and it has a numeric label of 34.\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about the number of shots made after a rebound, which implies the end state.
