  "full_response": " Patients going to the floor is indeterminate.\n The patients discharged-alive can be tracked directly from Emergency node.\n It shows that 38 patients went to \"Discharge-Alive\", then 38 patients went to \"_Exit\".\n So 38 patients were discharged alive after going to the Discharge-Alive node.\n\n The question is about patients being discharged-alive *after going to the Floor*. Since the graph doesn't show any \"Floor\" node, it is impossible to say the number of patients who were discharged alive *after going to the floor*.\n\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
