  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of shots made directly after a rebound. I need to find the path from the \"Rebound\" node to the \"Made Shot\" node. There is a link connecting these two nodes, and the number associated with the link is 15. Therefore, there were 15 shots made directly after a rebound.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** We need to find the \"Rebound\" node and the \"Made Shot\" node that follows it.\n2.  **Trace the path:** Look for the link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\". The number next to the link represents the count.\n3.  **Extract the count:** The link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with \"15\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about the number of shots made directly after a rebound.
