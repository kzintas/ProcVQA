  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of rebounds. I need to locate all the \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram and sum up the values associated with these nodes to find the total number of rebounds.\nThere are two \"Rebound\" nodes. One has a value of 19 and the other has a value of 15.\nAdding these values together: 19 + 15 = 34.\nTherefore, there were a total of 34 rebounds made.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant elements:** The question asks about rebounds, so I need to find all nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and note the values associated with the links leading to them.\n2.  **Analyze the diagram:**\n    *   There are two nodes labeled \"Rebound\".\n    *   The first \"Rebound\" node has a value of 19 next to it.\n    *   The second \"Rebound\" node has a value of 15 next to it.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Add the values of the links leading to each \"Rebound\" node: 19 + 15 = 34\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the total number of rebounds.
