  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about patients who died after arriving at the Emergency node. The diagram shows that out of 100 patients who arrived at the Emergency node, 62 went to ICU. From the ICU, 36 patients went to the 'Die' node and then to the '_Exit' node. Thus, 36 patients died after Emergency through the ICU route. The other path from Emergency leads to 'Discharge-Alive' so these patients are not relevant to the question about deaths. Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
