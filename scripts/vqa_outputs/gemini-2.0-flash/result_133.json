  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a rebound. I need to identify the 'Rebound' node and see which node directly follows it representing a made shot and what the link value is. The 'Rebound' node has a link labeled '15' to the node 'Made Shot'. Thus, there were 15 made shots directly after a rebound.",
  "full_response": "1. The question asks about shots made directly after a Rebound.\n2. I need to identify the \"Rebound\" node and the paths originating from it.\n3.
