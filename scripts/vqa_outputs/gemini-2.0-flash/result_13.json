From \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\", the link also has a value of 38.\n   - From \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\", the link has a value of 24. From \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\", the link also has a value of 24.\n   - The total number of patients discharged alive is 38 + 24 = 62.\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n<answer>62</answer>\n",
