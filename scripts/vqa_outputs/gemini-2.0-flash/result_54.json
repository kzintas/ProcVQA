  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks the total number of patients who were discharged alive, meaning a sum is needed of all of the patients that reach a Discharge-Alive node. Starting from the 'Emergency' node, 38 patients were discharged alive. Separately, starting again from the 'Emergency' node, 21 patients went to 'Floor', 21 patients continued to 'ICU', 24 patients continued to the second 'Floor', and 24 patients from that second 'Floor' node ended up at 'Discharge-Alive'. The total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of these two pathways, or 38 + 24 = 62.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant nodes:** The question asks about patients who were discharged alive. The relevant nodes are \"Discharge-Alive\". There are two \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes in the diagram.\n2.  **Trace paths leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes:**\n    *   The first \"Discharge-Alive\" node is reached directly from \"Emergency\" with a count of 38.\n    *   The second \"Discharge-Alive\" node is reached via the nodes \"Emergency\" -> \"Floor\" -> \"ICU\" -> \"Floor\" -> \"Discharge-Alive\", with corresponding counts of 21, 21, 24, and 24 respectively.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of discharged alive patients:** Add the counts of sequences leading to each \"Discharge-Alive\" node: 38 + 24 = 62.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks the total number of patients who were discharged alive, meaning a sum is needed of all of the patients that reach a Discharge-Alive node.
