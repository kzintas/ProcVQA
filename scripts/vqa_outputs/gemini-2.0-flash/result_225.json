  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.\nI need to find paths where UNC Offense is followed by a Missed Shot and then UMD Offense, and sum the counts along those paths.\n\nI identified only one path satisfying the criteria: UNC Offense (19) -> Missed Shot (19) -> UMD Offense (17). So, the total count is 19.",
  "full_response": "1. Identify the relevant nodes:\n    - UNC Offense\n    - Missed Shot\n    - UMD Offense\n\n2. Trace the paths from UNC Offense to Missed Shot, and then to UMD Offense:\n    - Path 1: UNC Offense (19) -> Missed Shot (19) -> UMD Offense (17)\n    - Path 2: UNC Offense (33) -> Missed Shot (18) -> _Exit (33) - This path does not lead to UMD Offense before _Exit.\n    - Path 3: UNC Offense (15) -> Foul (15) -> UMD Offense (11) - This path does not lead to Missed Shot before UMD Offense.\n    - Path 4: UNC Offense (2) -> Missed Shot (2) -> Made Shot (2) -> _Exit (2)\n\n3. Count the number of sequences following the identified paths where Missed Shot occurs between UNC Offense and UMD Offense:\n    - From UNC Offense (19) there is a Missed Shot (19) which goes to UMD Offense (17) with a count of 19.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.\nI need to find paths where UNC Offense is followed by a Missed Shot and then UMD Offense, and sum the counts along those paths.\n\nI identified only one path satisfying the criteria: UNC Offense (19) -> Missed Shot (19) -> UMD Offense (17).
