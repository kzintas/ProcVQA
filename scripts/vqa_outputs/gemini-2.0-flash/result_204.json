  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant nodes:** We need to find instances of \"UNC Offense\" followed by \"Missed Shot\" and then \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  **Trace pathways:**\n    *   Starting with \"_Start\" (7) followed by \"UNC Offense\" (7), \"Missed Shot\" (7), then \"UMD Offense\" (7), so that's 1 instance.\n    *   Starting with \"_Start\" (14) followed by \"UNC Offense\" (14), \"Rebound\" (14), \"Missed Shot\" (14), then \"UMD Offense\" (13), so that's another instance.\n\n3.  **Count missed shots:** In the first instance, 1 missed shot occurs. In the second instance, 1 missed shot occurs. In total 1 + 1 = 2 missed shots.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",
