  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "1. The question asks about the number of \"Jump Ball\" events that occurred after \"UNC Offense\".\n2. First, I identify \"UNC Offense\" events. There are 6 \"UNC Offense\" start nodes labeled with counts 2, 14, 12, 14, 9, and 18, respectively.\n3. I need to look at which of these \"UNC Offense\" events are followed by a \"Jump Ball\" event.\n4. I can see that the first \"UNC Offense\" event with a count of 2 is preceded by a \"_Start\" node with count 2, and it leads to a \"Jump Ball\" event with a count of 1.\n5. No other \"UNC Offense\" events lead to a \"Jump Ball\" event.\n6. Therefore, \"Jump Ball\" happened 1 time after \"UNC Offense\".\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
