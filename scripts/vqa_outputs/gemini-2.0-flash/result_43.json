From the 'Emergency' node, I see two outgoing links: one to 'Floor' with a value of 21, and another to 'Discharge-Alive' with a value of 38.\n4. The question specifically asks about being discharged alive directly after the Emergency, so I need to look at the number on the link between the 'Emergency' node and the 'Discharge-Alive' node.\n5. The number on that link is 38.\n\n<answer>38</answer>",
