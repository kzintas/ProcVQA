  "full_response": "1. The question asks about the number of patients who went to the ICU after the Emergency event.\n2. I need to find pathways from Emergency to ICU and count the number of patients for each of these pathways.\n3. From the diagram, I see four different pathways starting from \"_Start\".\n4. The first pathway is: _Start(12) -> Arrival(12) -> Emergency(12) -> ICU(12) -> Die_Exit(12). Here, 12 patients went to ICU after Emergency.\n5. The second pathway is: _Start(37) -> Arrival(37) -> Emergency(37) -> Discharge-Alive_Exit(37). No patients went to ICU after Emergency in this pathway.\n6. The third pathway is: _Start(24) -> Arrival(24) -> Emergency(24) -> ICU(23) -> Floor(23) -> Discharge-Alive(20) -> _Exit(24). Here, 23 patients went to ICU after Emergency.\n7. The fourth pathway is: _Start(27) -> Arrival(27) -> Emergency(27) -> Floor(27) -> ICU(24) -> Die(18) -> _Exit(27). No patients went to ICU directly after Emergency in this pathway.\n\n8. Thus, a total of 12 + 23 = 35 patients went to ICU after Emergency.\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
