  "reasoning": "1.  Identified that the question is asking for the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.\n2.  Identified the path Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die -> _Exit as the relevant path.\n3.  Extracted the number of patients that followed each link in the path: Emergency -> Floor (41), Floor -> ICU (21), ICU -> Die (36), and Die -> _Exit (21).\n4.  Since the question is asking how many patients died after arriving at Emergency, the number of patients that followed the ICU -> Die link is the answer.\n5.  Therefore, the answer is 36.",
