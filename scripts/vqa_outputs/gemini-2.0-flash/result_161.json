I find a link between the UMD Offense node and the Rebound node with the number 27. Therefore, the number of rebounds made after UMD Offense is 27.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the relevant nodes:** We need to find the \"UMD Offense\" node and the \"Rebound\" node immediately after it.\n2.  **Trace the link:** Look for a directed link connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\". The number on the link will tell us how many sequences followed that path.\n3.  **Extract the count:** The link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Rebound\" has the number 27 labeled on it.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the number of rebounds that happen after the UMD Offense.
