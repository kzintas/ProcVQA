  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks about the number of times a Jump Ball occurred after UNC Offense.\nThe visualization shows a node labeled \"UNC Offense\" followed by a node labeled \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1. No other \"UNC Offense\" node is directly connected to \"Jump Ball\".",
  "full_response": "1. **Identify relevant nodes:** The question asks about events occurring *after* \"UNC Offense\". We need to locate the \"UNC Offense\" node in the diagram. There are multiple UNC Offense nodes, with counts of 2, 13, 26, 21, and 7 respectively. The next event after the first UNC Offense (count of 2) is Jump Ball with a count of 1, and Missed Shot with a count of 2.\n2. **Trace pathways:** We are looking for the number of times \"Jump Ball\" occurred immediately after \"UNC Offense\". Only the \"UNC Offense\" node on the very left with a count of 2, leads to a \"Jump Ball\" node with a count of 1.\n3. **Final Answer:** Therefore, \"Jump Ball\" occurred 1 time after \"UNC Offense\".\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about the number of times a Jump Ball occurred after UNC Offense.\nThe visualization shows a node labeled \"UNC Offense\" followed by a node labeled \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1.
