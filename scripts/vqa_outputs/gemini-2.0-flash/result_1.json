  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant nodes and links:** I need to find all paths leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes and sum the number of patients following those paths.\n2.  **Trace pathways:**\n    *   From \"Emergency\" there are two branches that end in Discharge-Alive.\n        *   One branch goes directly from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a value of 38.\n        *   Another branch goes from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" with a value of 62, then to \"Floor\" with a value of 24, then to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a value of 24.\n3.  **Calculate total patients discharged alive:** Add the counts from each pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\": 38 + 24 = 62\n\n```xml\n<reasoning>\n1.
