  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks how many times the \"UMD Offense\" did not transition to \"Rebound\".  From the node-link diagram, we can see two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\": one to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34, and one to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.  Therefore, the \"UMD Offense\" did not transition to \"Rebound\" 35 times because it transitioned to \"_Exit\" 35 times.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the nodes and links of interest:**\n    *   We are interested in the \"UMD Offense\" node and its outgoing links.\n    *   We want to find out how many times UMD Offense *did not* transition to \"Rebound.\"\n\n2.  **Examine the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\":**\n    *   One link goes from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a value of 34.\n    *   Another link goes from \"UMD Offense\" to \"\\_Exit\" with a value of 35.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to Rebound:**\n    *   The link to Rebound tells us that 34 sequences transitioned from UMD Offense to Rebound.\n    *   The question is, how many times did UMD Offense *not* transition to Rebound? The UMD Offense transitioned to Rebound 34 times and transitioned to \\_Exit 35 times. So, UMD Offense transitioned to something that was not Rebound 35 times.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:**\n    *The number of times that the UMD Offense did not transition to Rebound is 35.*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks how many times the \"UMD Offense\" did not transition to \"Rebound\".  From the node-link diagram, we can see two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\": one to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34, and one to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.
