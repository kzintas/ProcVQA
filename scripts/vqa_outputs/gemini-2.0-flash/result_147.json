  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that UMD Offense transitions to either Rebound or _Exit. We are asked to find the number of times that UMD Offense did *not* go to Rebound. This corresponds to the number of times that UMD Offense goes to _Exit. The link from UMD Offense to _Exit has a numeric label of 35. Therefore, UMD Offense did not transition to Rebound 35 times.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify the nodes:** The relevant nodes are \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"\\_Exit\".\n2.  **Identify the links:** There are two links originating from \"UMD Offense\". One goes to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34, and the other goes to \"\\_Exit\" with a count of 35.\n3.  **Determine the count:** The question asks for the number of times \"UMD Offense\" *did not* transition to \"Rebound\". This is represented by the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"\\_Exit\", which has a count of 35.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that UMD Offense transitions to either Rebound or _Exit.
