  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows the flow of patients between different events. The question specifically asks about the number of patients that went to ICU *after* the Emergency event. I need to locate the node named 'Emergency', then find the outgoing link that goes to the node 'ICU'. The number next to that link represents the number of patients that follow that path. By observing the graph, there is one link that connects 'Emergency' to 'ICU' and it has the number 62 associated to it. This means 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.",
