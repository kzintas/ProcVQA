  "true_answer": "21",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but not after \"UMD Offense\". I need to trace all paths originating from \"UNC Offense\" and count the instances where \"Missed Shot\" appears subsequently. Then I need to trace all paths originating from \"UMD Offense\" and count the instances where \"Missed Shot\" appears subsequently. Finally subtract the number of missed shots after \"UMD Offense\" from the number of missed shots after \"UNC Offense\".",
