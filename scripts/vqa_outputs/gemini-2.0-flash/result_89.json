  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. The question asks to find the number of patients who went to 'Floor' after 'ICU'.\n2. Looking at the third column, there is a direct path from 'ICU' to 'Floor' with a count of 23.\n3. Looking at the fourth column, there is a path from 'Floor' to 'ICU' but not from 'ICU' to 'Floor'.\n4. Therefore, the total number of patients who went to 'Floor' after 'ICU' is 23.",
  "full_response": "1.  **Identify relevant elements**: The question asks about the number of patients who went to the 'Floor' after the 'ICU'. This requires us to trace the paths originating from the 'ICU' nodes to the 'Floor' nodes.\n2.  **Analyze paths**:\n    *   In the third column, there is a path from ICU to Floor with a count of 23.\n    *   In the fourth column, there is no path from ICU to Floor. Instead, there is path from Floor to ICU.\n3.  **Calculate the answer**: Sum the counts for all direct paths from 'ICU' to 'Floor':  23.\n\n```xml\n<reasoning>\n1.
