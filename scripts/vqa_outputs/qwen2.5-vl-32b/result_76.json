  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",

  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify the pathway in the diagram that leads to \"Discharge-Alive\" after going through the \"Floor\" node. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathways:\n- The diagram shows multiple pathways starting from `_Start` and leading to various outcomes.\n- We are specifically interested in the pathway that includes the \"Floor\" node and ends at \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### 2. Locate the \"Floor\" node:\n- There are two instances of the \"Floor\" node in the diagram:\n  - One is in the third column (with 23 patients).\n  - One is in the fourth column (with 27 patients).\n\n### 3. Trace the pathways from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\":\n- From the \"Floor\" node in the third column (23 patients):\n  - This node leads directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" with 20 patients.\n- From the \"Floor\" node in the fourth column (27 patients):\n  - This node does not lead to \"Discharge-Alive.\" Instead, it leads to \"Die\" with 18 patients and then to `_Exit`.\n\n### 4. Sum the patients discharged alive after going to the Floor:\n- Only the \"Floor\" node in the third column contributes to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n- The number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 20.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The only valid pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" after going through \"Floor\" is the one in the third column.\n- This pathway shows 20 patients being discharged alive.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>20</answer>",
