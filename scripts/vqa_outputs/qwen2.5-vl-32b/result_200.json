  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total rebounds are there in the match?\" based on the provided node-link diagram, let's analyze the visualization step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events in a match, starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- The event \"Rebound\" is a node in the diagram, and it is connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n- The link leading to the \"Rebound\" node has a numeric label of **24**, indicating the number of sequences that follow this path.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Diagram\n- The \"Rebound\" node is directly connected to the \"UMD Offense\" node, and the link between them is labeled with the number **24**.\n- This number (24) represents the total number of sequences where a rebound occurred after the \"UMD Offense\" phase.\n- There are no other paths or nodes labeled as \"Rebound\" in the diagram, so this is the only instance of rebounds being counted.\n\n### 3. Thought Process and Calculations\n- The question asks for the total number of rebounds in the match.\n- From the diagram, the only relevant information about rebounds is the link labeled **24** leading to the \"Rebound\" node.\n- Since there are no other rebounds shown in the diagram, the total number of rebounds is simply the value on this link.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the total number of rebounds in the match is explicitly shown as **24**.\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
