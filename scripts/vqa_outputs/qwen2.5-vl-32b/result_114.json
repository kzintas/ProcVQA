  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UNC Offense\" is a node, and \"UMD Offense\" is another node.\n- We need to look for a directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" and check the count associated with that link.\n\n### 2. Locate the transition in the diagram:\n- Starting from the \"UNC Offense\" node, we observe the outgoing links.\n- There is a directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The numeric label on this link is **34**.\n\n### 3. Interpret the link count:\n- The numeric label next to the link indicates the number of sequences that follow this path.\n- Therefore, the count **34** represents the number of times the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" occurred.\n\n### 4. Verify the context:\n- The diagram shows a clear pathway from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a labeled count.\n- No other paths or ambiguities are present that would affect this count.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The question asks for the number of times \"UMD Offense\" transitioned from \"UNC Offense.\"\n- The diagram explicitly shows a link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of **34**.\n- This count directly answers the question without any need for further calculations or assumptions.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>34</answer>",
