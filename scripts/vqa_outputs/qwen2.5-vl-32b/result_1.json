  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total patients were discharged alive?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and pathways:\n- The diagram shows a flow of patients starting from `_Start` and ending at various outcomes.\n- The node labeled `Discharge-Alive` represents patients who were discharged alive.\n- There are two pathways leading to `Discharge-Alive`:\n  1. Directly from `Emergency` to `Discharge-Alive`.\n  2. From `Emergency` to `Floor` to `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### 2. Examine the counts on the links:\n- The link from `Emergency` to `Discharge-Alive` has a count of **38**.\n- The link from `Emergency` to `Floor` has a count of **62**.\n- The link from `Floor` to `Discharge-Alive` has a count of **24**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of patients discharged alive:\n- Patients discharged alive directly from `Emergency`: **38**.\n- Patients discharged alive via `Floor`: **24**.\n- Total patients discharged alive = 38 + 24 = **62**.\n\n### 4. Verify the total patient count:\n- The total number of patients starting from `_Start` is **100**.\n- The diagram shows all patients are accounted for in the pathways:\n  - 38 to `Discharge-Alive` directly.\n  - 62 to `ICU` (of which 36 die and 24 are discharged alive via `Floor`).\n  - 38 to `_Exit` (died in `Emergency`).\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>62</answer>",
