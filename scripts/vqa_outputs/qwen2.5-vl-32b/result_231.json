  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" occurred after \"UNC Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UNC Offense\" is represented as a node with a label and a specific color (orange).\n- We need to look for directed links from \"UNC Offense\" nodes to \"Jump Ball\" nodes.\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways:\n#### Pathway 1:\n- Start at the top-left section of the diagram.\n- The first \"UNC Offense\" node has a count of 19.\n- From this \"UNC Offense\" node, there is a link to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n- The numeric label next to this link shows the count: **1**.\n\n#### Pathway 2:\n- Move to the second \"UNC Offense\" node in the diagram (count = 12).\n- From this \"UNC Offense\" node, there is no link to a \"Jump Ball\" node. Instead, it directly leads to a \"Foul\" node.\n\n#### Pathway 3:\n- Move to the third \"UNC Offense\" node in the diagram (count = 8).\n- From this \"UNC Offense\" node, there is no link to a \"Jump Ball\" node. Instead, it directly leads to a \"Turnover\" node.\n\n#### Pathway 4:\n- Move to the fourth \"UNC Offense\" node in the diagram (count = 28).\n- From this \"UNC Offense\" node, there is no link to a \"Jump Ball\" node. Instead, it directly leads to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n\n### 3. Summarize the findings:\n- Only one pathway shows a link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball.\"\n- The count associated with this link is **1**.\n\n### 4. Final Answer:\n<answer>1</answer>",
