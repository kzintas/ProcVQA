  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- We need to focus on the pathways involving \"UMD Offense\" and specifically look for links leading to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n- The diagram shows sequences of events, with link widths and numeric labels indicating the number of sequences following each path.\n\n### 2. Trace the Pathways Involving \"UMD Offense\"\n- Starting from the \"Start\" node, we see multiple branches leading to different events.\n- One of these branches leads to \"UMD Offense,\" which is colored in gray.\n\n#### Pathway Analysis:\n- From \"Start,\" there are several paths leading to \"UMD Offense.\" We need to follow these paths to see if any lead to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n##### Path 1: Direct Path to \"UMD Offense\"\n- From \"Start,\" there is a direct path to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 9 sequences.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there is a link to \"Made Shot\" (purple) with a count of 17 sequences.\n- There is no direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\" in this pathway.\n\n##### Path 2: Through \"Missed Shot\"\n- Another path from \"Start\" goes through \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Missed Shot\" \u2192 \"Rebound\" \u2192 \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From \"UMD Offense\" in this pathway, there is a link to \"Made Free Throw\" (cyan) with a count of 6 sequences.\n\n##### Path 3: Through \"Foul\"\n- Another path from \"Start\" goes through \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Foul\" \u2192 \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From \"UMD Offense\" in this pathway, there is a link to \"Made Free Throw\" (cyan) with a count of 10 sequences.\n\n### 3. Summarize the Counts of \"Made Free Throw\" for UMD Offense\n- From the analysis above, we see two pathways where \"UMD Offense\" leads to \"Made Free Throw\":\n  1. Path through \"Rebound\": 6 sequences\n  2. Path through \"Foul\": 10 sequences\n\n- Adding these counts together:\n  \\[\n  6 + 10 = 16\n  \\]\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is the sum of the sequences leading to \"Made Free Throw\" from \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n<answer>16</answer>",
