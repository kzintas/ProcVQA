  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur after the \"UNC Offense\" node but before the \"UMD Offense\" node. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and links:\n- The starting point is the \"UNC Offense\" node.\n- We need to look for \"Made Shot\" nodes that are directly connected to the \"UNC Offense\" node or any subsequent nodes leading up to \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The \"UMD Offense\" node marks the end of the sequence we are interested in.\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways from \"UNC Offense\":\nFrom the \"UNC Offense\" node, there are several outgoing links. We need to focus on the ones that lead to a \"Made Shot\" node before reaching \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n#### Pathways from \"UNC Offense\":\n- **Link to \"Rebound\" (count: 23)**: This does not lead directly to a \"Made Shot.\"\n- **Link to \"Foul\" (count: 8)**: This leads to a \"Made Free Throw\" node, not a \"Made Shot.\"\n- **Link to \"Rebound\" (count: 4)**: This does not lead directly to a \"Made Shot.\"\n- **Link to \"Made Shot\" (count: 4)**: This is a direct \"Made Shot\" after \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n### 3. Count the \"Made Shot\" events:\n- There is only one direct link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot,\" with a count of 4.\n\n### 4. Verify no other \"Made Shot\" nodes before \"UMD Offense\":\n- After the \"Made Shot\" node with a count of 4, the next node is \"Turnover,\" which leads to \"UMD Offense.\" There are no other \"Made Shot\" nodes before reaching \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total number of \"Made Shot\" events after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\" is 4.\n\n<answer>4</answer>",
