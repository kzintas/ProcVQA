  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "3",
  "llm_answer": "3",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- We are looking for sequences where \"UMD Offense\" leads to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n- The diagram shows pathways with links and their counts, which indicate the number of sequences following each path.\n\n### 2. Locate the \"UMD Offense\" nodes:\n- There are multiple \"UMD Offense\" nodes in the diagram. We need to check each one to see if it leads to a \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n### 3. Examine each \"UMD Offense\" node:\n#### Pathway 1:\n- Starting from the top-left section:\n  - \"UMD Offense\" (count: 17) leads to \"Made Shot\" (count: 8).\n  - There is no link from this \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n#### Pathway 2:\n- In the middle section:\n  - \"UMD Offense\" (count: 10) leads to \"Made Free Throw\" (count: 3).\n  - This is a valid pathway where UMD made free throws.\n\n#### Pathway 3:\n- In the right section:\n  - \"UMD Offense\" (count: 25) leads to \"Missed Shot\" (count: 19).\n  - There is no link from this \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n### 4. Summarize the findings:\n- The only pathway where \"UMD Offense\" leads to \"Made Free Throw\" is in the middle section.\n- The count of sequences for this pathway is 3.\n\n### 5. Final Answer:\nThe number of free throws made by UMD Offense is the count of sequences in the pathway from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw,\" which is 3.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",
