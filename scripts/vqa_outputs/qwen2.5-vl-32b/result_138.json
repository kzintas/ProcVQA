  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and progressing through various nodes.\n- The node `UNC Offense` is connected to `UMD Offense` with a directed link.\n- The link between `UNC Offense` and `UMD Offense` has a numeric label of **69**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the meaning of the link label\n- The numeric label on a link represents the number of sequences that follow that particular path.\n- In this case, the label **69** on the link from `UNC Offense` to `UMD Offense` indicates that there are 69 sequences where the transition from `UNC Offense` to `UMD Offense` occurred.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the context\n- The question asks specifically about the number of times `UMD Offense` transitioned from `UNC Offense`.\n- The diagram explicitly shows this transition with the labeled link, and no other paths or ambiguities are present.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the answer\n- The label on the link directly provides the required information.\n- There is no need for further calculation or interpretation beyond what is explicitly shown.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>69</answer>",
