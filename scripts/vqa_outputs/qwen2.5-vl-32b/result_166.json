  "question": "How many fouls were made after UNC Offense and before UMD offense? ",
  "true_answer": "8",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to analyze the node-link diagram and identify the number of fouls that occur after the \"UNC Offense\" node and before the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the \"UNC Offense\" Node:**\n   - The \"UNC Offense\" node is clearly labeled and is a central node in the diagram.\n   - It has multiple outgoing links representing different events that can occur after UNC Offense.\n\n2. **Locate the \"Foul\" Node(s) After \"UNC Offense\":**\n   - From the \"UNC Offense\" node, there is a direct link to a \"Foul\" node.\n   - The link to the \"Foul\" node is labeled with the number 8, indicating that 8 sequences involve a foul after UNC Offense.\n\n3. **Check for Any Intermediate Nodes Between \"Foul\" and \"UMD Offense\":**\n   - The \"Foul\" node after \"UNC Offense\" leads directly to the \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n   - The \"Made Free Throw\" node then leads to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n   - There are no additional \"Foul\" nodes between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n4. **Count the Fouls:**\n   - The only \"Foul\" node that occurs after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\" is the one directly connected to \"UNC Offense.\"\n   - The number of sequences involving this \"Foul\" is explicitly labeled as 8.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The \"Foul\" node after \"UNC Offense\" is the only relevant \"Foul\" node in the sequence before reaching \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The link to this \"Foul\" node is labeled with the number 8, indicating 8 sequences.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>8</answer>",
