  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The **UNC Offense** node is at the top of the diagram.\n- From UNC Offense, there are two possible transitions:\n  - To **Rebound** (with a link count of 15).\n  - To **Made Shot** (with a link count of 22).\n- The **UMD Offense** node is shown below these transitions.\n- We need to determine how many times UMD Offense directly follows UNC Offense.\n\n### 2. Trace the Pathways\n- From UNC Offense, the only direct transition leading to UMD Offense is through the **Missed Shot** pathway.\n- The link from **Missed Shot** to **UMD Offense** has a count of **35**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Counts\n- The total number of sequences starting from UNC Offense is 69 (as indicated by the link count from _Start to UNC Offense).\n- Of these 69 sequences:\n  - 22 sequences result in a **Made Shot**.\n  - The remaining sequences (69 - 22 = 47) must lead to **Missed Shot**.\n  - Out of these 47 sequences that lead to Missed Shot, all 35 sequences transition to UMD Offense.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe number of times UMD Offense transitions from UNC Offense is explicitly shown as **35** on the link from Missed Shot to UMD Offense.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
