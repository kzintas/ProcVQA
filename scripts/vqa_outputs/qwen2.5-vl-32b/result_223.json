  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify all pathways in the diagram where the UNC offense results in a \"Made Shot\" and count the number of sequences for those specific paths.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Point for UNC Offense:**\n   - The diagram shows multiple starting points labeled \"_Start,\" with different counts. We focus on the paths where \"UNC Offense\" is indicated.\n\n2. **Trace Paths from UNC Offense to Made Shot:**\n   - There are two main branches from \"UNC Offense\":\n     - One branch leads directly to \"Made Shot.\"\n     - Another branch leads to \"Missed Shot,\" which then can lead to other outcomes.\n\n3. **Count Sequences for Each Path:**\n   - **Path 1:** \n     - Start \u2192 UNC Offense (count = 13) \u2192 Made Shot (count = 20)\n     - This path shows that 20 sequences result in a \"Made Shot\" directly from UNC Offense.\n   - **Path 2:**\n     - Start \u2192 UNC Offense (count = 26) \u2192 Missed Shot (count = 25) \u2192 Rebound (count = 26) \u2192 UMD Offense (count = 9) \u2192 Made Shot (count = 9)\n     - This path does not contribute to shots made by UNC Offense since it transitions to UMD Offense.\n\n4. **Summarize the Results:**\n   - The only direct path where UNC Offense results in a \"Made Shot\" is the one with a count of 20.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>20</answer>",
