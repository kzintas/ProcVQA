  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify all pathways in the diagram where a \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\" Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant pathways\n- We start from the node labeled \"_Start\" and follow the paths that lead to \"UNC Offense.\"\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" we look for any subsequent nodes labeled \"Missed Shot.\"\n- After identifying \"Missed Shot,\" we ensure that the next node is not \"UMD Offense\" until we reach it.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each branch from \"_Start\"\n#### Branch 1: Top-left pathway\n1. **_Start (7)** \u2192 **UNC Offense (7)**\n2. From \"UNC Offense (7)\":\n   - Directly leads to **Missed Shot (7)**.\n   - Then to **Rebound (7)**.\n   - Followed by **UMD Offense (7)**.\n\n   Here, one \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n#### Branch 2: Second pathway from top\n1. **_Start (14)** \u2192 **UNC Offense (14)**\n2. From \"UNC Offense (14)\":\n   - Directly leads to **Missed Shot (14)**.\n   - Then to **Rebound (14)**.\n   - Followed by **UMD Offense (14)**.\n\n   Here, one \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n#### Branch 3: Third pathway from top\n1. **_Start (4)** \u2192 **UNC Offense (4)**\n2. From \"UNC Offense (4)\":\n   - Directly leads to **Rebound (1)** and **Turnover (2)**.\n   - Neither of these leads to \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n   No \"Missed Shot\" occurs in this branch.\n\n#### Branch 4: Fourth pathway from top\n1. **_Start (4)** \u2192 **UNC Offense (4)**\n2. From \"UNC Offense (4)\":\n   - Directly leads to **Jump Ball (1)**.\n   - Then to **Foul (3)**.\n   - Followed by **UMD Offense (2)**.\n\n   No \"Missed Shot\" occurs in this branch.\n\n#### Branch 5: Fifth pathway from top\n1. **_Start (15)** \u2192 **UNC Offense (15)**\n2. From \"UNC Offense (15)\":\n   - Directly leads to **Foul (15)**.\n   - Then to **Made Free Throw (13)**.\n   - Followed by **UMD Offense (23)**.\n\n   No \"Missed Shot\" occurs in this branch.\n\n#### Branch 6: Rightmost pathway\n1. **_Start (25)** \u2192 **UNC Offense (25)**\n2. From \"UNC Offense (25)\":\n   - Directly leads to **Made Shot (21)**.\n   - Then to **UMD Offense (23)**.\n\n   No \"Missed Shot\" occurs in this branch.\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the findings\n- From the analysis, we see that \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\" in two branches:\n  1. The first branch with a count of 7.\n  2. The second branch with a count of 14.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total\nThe total number of missed shots occurring after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense\" is:\n\\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>21</answer>",
