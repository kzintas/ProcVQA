  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathway:\n- The question asks about patients who were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n- We need to look for a direct path from the \"Arrival\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node without any intermediate steps.\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways:\n- From the diagram, we can see that there are multiple sequences starting from `_Start` and leading to different outcomes.\n- For each sequence, we need to check if there is a direct path from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n#### Sequence 1:\n- Starts at `_Start (12)`\n- Goes to \"Arrival (12)\"\n- Directly goes to \"Emergency (12)\"\n- Then goes to \"ICU (12)\"\n- Finally, goes to \"Die _Exit (12)\"\n\n**No direct path from Arrival to Discharge-Alive in this sequence.**\n\n#### Sequence 2:\n- Starts at `_Start (37)`\n- Goes to \"Arrival (37)\"\n- Directly goes to \"Emergency (37)\"\n- Then goes to \"Discharge-Alive _Exit (37)\"\n\n**This sequence shows a direct path from Arrival to Discharge-Alive. The count of sequences following this path is 37.**\n\n#### Sequence 3:\n- Starts at `_Start (24)`\n- Goes to \"Arrival (24)\"\n- Directly goes to \"Emergency (24)\"\n- Then goes to \"ICU (23)\"\n- Next, goes to \"Floor (23)\"\n- Finally, goes to \"Discharge-Alive (20)\"\n\n**No direct path from Arrival to Discharge-Alive in this sequence.**\n\n#### Sequence 4:\n- Starts at `_Start (27)`\n- Goes to \"Arrival (27)\"\n- Directly goes to \"Emergency (27)\"\n- Then goes to \"Floor (27)\"\n- Next, goes to \"ICU (24)\"\n- Finally, goes to \"Die _Exit (18)\"\n\n**No direct path from Arrival to Discharge-Alive in this sequence.**\n\n### 3. Count the patients:\n- Only Sequence 2 shows a direct path from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n- The number of sequences following this path is 37.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>37</answer>",
