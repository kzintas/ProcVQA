  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- We need to focus on the pathways involving \"UMD Offense\" and specifically look for \"Made Free Throw\" events.\n- The diagram shows sequences of events with numerical labels indicating the number of sequences following each path.\n\n### 2. Trace the Pathways Involving UMD Offense\n#### Pathway 1:\n- Start at `_Start` (UNC Offense) \u2192 `Missed Shot` \u2192 `Rebound` \u2192 `UMD Offense` \u2192 `Made Free Throw`\n  - Number of sequences: \n    - `_Start` (UNC Offense): 7\n    - `Missed Shot`: 7\n    - `Rebound`: 7\n    - `UMD Offense`: 7\n    - `Made Free Throw`: 13\n\n#### Pathway 2:\n- Start at `_Start` (UNC Offense) \u2192 `Turnover` \u2192 `UMD Offense` \u2192 `Made Free Throw`\n  - Number of sequences:\n    - `_Start` (UNC Offense): 4\n    - `Turnover`: 2\n    - `UMD Offense`: 2\n    - `Made Free Throw`: 8\n\n### 3. Sum the Sequences for Made Free Throws by UMD Offense\n- From Pathway 1: 13 sequences\n- From Pathway 2: 8 sequences\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total\n- Total made free throws by UMD Offense = 13 + 8 = 21\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>21</answer>",
