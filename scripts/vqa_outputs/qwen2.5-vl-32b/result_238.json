  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" occurred after \"UNC Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UNC Offense\" is represented as a node with a specific color (orange) and label.\n- We need to look for directed links from \"UNC Offense\" nodes to \"Jump Ball\" nodes.\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways:\n- Starting from the \"Start\" node, we see that there are two sequences leading to \"UNC Offense\" (with counts 2 and 14).\n- From the \"UNC Offense\" nodes, we need to trace the links to see if any lead to \"Jump Ball.\"\n\n### 3. Trace the links:\n- The first \"UNC Offense\" node (count 2) does not have a link to \"Jump Ball.\" Instead, it leads to \"Missed Shot.\"\n- The second \"UNC Offense\" node (count 14) also does not have a direct link to \"Jump Ball.\" Instead, it leads to \"Rebound.\"\n\n### 4. Check for any indirect paths:\n- There are no indirect paths from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" in the diagram. The \"Jump Ball\" node is only reachable from the \"Start\" node, not from any \"UNC Offense\" node.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\n- Based on the diagram, there are no sequences where a \"Jump Ball\" occurs after \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>0</answer>",
