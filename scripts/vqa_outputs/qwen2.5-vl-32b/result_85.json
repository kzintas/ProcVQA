  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathways:\n- The question focuses on patients who:\n  1. Start at `_Start`.\n  2. Go through `Arrival`.\n  3. Proceed to `Emergency`.\n  4. Eventually reach the `_Exit` node labeled `Die`.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathways:\n#### Pathway 1: `_Start` \u2192 `Arrival` \u2192 `Emergency` \u2192 `ICU` \u2192 `Floor` \u2192 `Die`\n- From `_Start` to `Arrival`: 27 patients.\n- From `Arrival` to `Emergency`: 27 patients.\n- From `Emergency` to `ICU`: 27 patients.\n- From `ICU` to `Floor`: 27 patients.\n- From `Floor` to `Die`: 27 patients.\n\n#### Pathway 2: `_Start` \u2192 `Arrival` \u2192 `Emergency` \u2192 `ICU` \u2192 `Die`\n- From `_Start` to `Arrival`: 24 patients.\n- From `Arrival` to `Emergency`: 24 patients.\n- From `Emergency` to `ICU`: 24 patients.\n- From `ICU` to `Die`: 18 patients.\n\n#### Pathway 3: `_Start` \u2192 `Arrival` \u2192 `Emergency` \u2192 `Die`\n- From `_Start` to `Arrival`: 12 patients.\n- From `Arrival` to `Emergency`: 12 patients.\n- From `Emergency` to `Die`: 12 patients.\n\n### 3. Sum the patients who died after arriving at Emergency:\n- From Pathway 1: 27 patients.\n- From Pathway 2: 18 patients.\n- From Pathway 3: 12 patients.\n\n### 4. Calculate the total:\n\\[ 27 + 18 + 12 = 57 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>57</answer>",
