  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total patients were discharged alive?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at various `_Exit` nodes.\n- The number next to each link represents the count of sequences following that path.\n- The node labeled `Discharge-Alive` is directly connected to an `_Exit` node, indicating patients who were discharged alive.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway to `Discharge-Alive`:\n- Starting from `_Start`, all patients proceed to `Arrival` (100 patients).\n- From `Arrival`, patients split into two paths:\n  - **Path 1**: To `Emergency` (100 patients).\n- From `Emergency`, patients split again:\n  - **Path 2**: To `ICU` (62 patients).\n  - **Path 3**: To `Discharge-Alive` (38 patients).\n\n### 3. Focus on the `Discharge-Alive` branch:\n- The link from `Emergency` to `Discharge-Alive` has a count of **38**.\n- This means 38 patients were discharged alive and proceeded directly to the `_Exit` node.\n\n### 4. Verify no other pathways lead to discharge alive:\n- The only direct path to `Discharge-Alive` is from `Emergency`.\n- No other nodes or links indicate additional patients being discharged alive.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe total number of patients discharged alive is explicitly shown as 38 in the diagram.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
