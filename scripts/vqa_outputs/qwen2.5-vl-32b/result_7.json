  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to analyze the pathways in the node-link diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and links:\n- The starting point is the `_Start` node, which has 100 sequences.\n- From `_Start`, all patients proceed to the `Arrival` node, which also has 100 sequences.\n- From `Arrival`, patients proceed to the `Emergency` node, which again has 100 sequences.\n- From `Emergency`, there are two main pathways:\n  - **Pathway 1**: Directly to `Discharge-Alive` with 38 sequences.\n  - **Pathway 2**: To `ICU` with 62 sequences.\n    - From `ICU`, there are two further pathways:\n      - To `Die` with 36 sequences.\n      - To `Floor` with 24 sequences.\n    - From `Floor`, all patients proceed to `Discharge-Alive` with 24 sequences.\n\n### 2. Calculate the total number of patients discharged alive:\n- **Direct discharge from Emergency**: 38 patients.\n- **Discharge via ICU and Floor**: 24 patients.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 38 + 24 = 62 \\]\n\n### 3. Verify the calculations:\n- The total number of patients entering `Emergency` is 100.\n- Of these:\n  - 38 go directly to `Discharge-Alive`.\n  - 62 go to `ICU`.\n    - Of the 62 in `ICU`:\n      - 36 die.\n      - 24 go to `Floor` and then to `Discharge-Alive`.\n- The sum of all outcomes from `Emergency` is:\n  \\[ 38 (\\text{direct discharge}) + 36 (\\text{die}) + 24 (\\text{via Floor}) = 100 \\]\n  This confirms the consistency of the data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>62</answer>",
