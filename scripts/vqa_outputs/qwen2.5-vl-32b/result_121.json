  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The node labeled **\"UMD Offense\"** is the starting point for this analysis.\n- From **\"UMD Offense\"**, there is a directed link to the node labeled **\"Rebound\"**.\n- The numeric label on the link from **\"UMD Offense\"** to **\"Rebound\"** is **34**.\n\n### 2. Interpret the link and its value:\n- The link width is proportional to the number of sequences following that path.\n- The numeric label **34** on the link indicates that there are **34 sequences** where the event \"Rebound\" occurred after \"UMD Offense\".\n\n### 3. Confirm the context:\n- The question asks specifically about the number of rebounds made by UMD Offense.\n- The link directly connecting **\"UMD Offense\"** to **\"Rebound\"** represents these rebounds.\n- No other paths or nodes related to rebounds are present in the diagram, so this is the only relevant data.\n\n### 4. Final reasoning:\n- The value **34** on the link from **\"UMD Offense\"** to **\"Rebound\"** explicitly indicates the number of rebounds made by UMD Offense.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>34</answer>",
