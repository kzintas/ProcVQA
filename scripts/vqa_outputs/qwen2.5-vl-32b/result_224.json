  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the occurrence of a \"Jump Ball\" after \"UNC Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UNC Offense\" is represented as a node with a label and a specific color (orange).\n- We need to look for any directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to a node labeled \"Jump Ball.\"\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways:\n- Starting from the top-left section of the diagram, we see an initial \"_Start\" node leading to \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 2.\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" there is a link to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1.\n- This is the only instance where \"Jump Ball\" follows \"UNC Offense\" in the diagram.\n\n### 3. Count the occurrences:\n- The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" has a numeric label of 1, indicating that this sequence occurred 1 time.\n\n### 4. Verify other sections:\n- There are other instances of \"UNC Offense\" in the diagram (e.g., in the middle and right sections), but none of these lead to a \"Jump Ball.\" Instead, they lead to other events like \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot.\"\n- Therefore, the only relevant pathway for the question is the one starting from the top-left \"_Start\" node.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The diagram shows a clear pathway from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1.\n- No other pathways involving \"Jump Ball\" after \"UNC Offense\" exist in the diagram.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>1</answer>",
