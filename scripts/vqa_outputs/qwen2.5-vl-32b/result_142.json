  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total shots were made by UMD offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The **UMD Offense** node is a key starting point.\n- From **UMD Offense**, there are two outgoing links:\n  - One leads to **Rebound** with a count of **34**.\n  - Another leads directly to **_Exit** with a count of **21**.\n- The **Rebound** node further splits into two paths:\n  - One leads to **Made Shot** with a count of **15**.\n  - Another leads directly to **_Exit** with a count of **19**.\n\n### 2. Understand the Question\nWe need to determine the total number of shots made by UMD during their offensive possessions. A \"shot\" in this context can be interpreted as any sequence that results in a **Made Shot** or a **Missed Shot**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Pathways\n#### Pathway 1: UMD Offense \u2192 Rebound \u2192 Made Shot\n- The link from **UMD Offense** to **Rebound** has a count of **34**.\n- From **Rebound**, **15** sequences lead to **Made Shot**.\n- Therefore, **15** shots were made after a rebound.\n\n#### Pathway 2: UMD Offense \u2192 Missed Shot\n- The link from **UMD Offense** directly to **_Exit** (via **Missed Shot**) has a count of **21**.\n- These **21** sequences represent missed shots because they do not go through the **Rebound** node and instead exit directly.\n\n### 4. Calculate Total Shots Made\n- **Shots made after a rebound**: **15**.\n- **Missed shots**: **21**.\n- Total shots = Shots made + Missed shots = **15 + 21 = 36**.\n\n### 5. Verify Completeness\n- All sequences originating from **UMD Offense** are accounted for:\n  - **34** sequences go to **Rebound**.\n  - **21** sequences go directly to **_Exit**.\n  - Total sequences from **UMD Offense**: **34 + 21 = 55**.\n- This matches the total number of sequences leaving **UMD Offense**, confirming our analysis is complete.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>36</answer>",
