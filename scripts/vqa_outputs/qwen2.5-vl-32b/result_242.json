  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to identify all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and sum the counts associated with them. Let's analyze the diagram step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all \"Missed Shot\" nodes\nWe will look for all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" and note the counts next to the incoming links.\n\n1. **First Pathway (Leftmost)**\n   - Node: \"Missed Shot\"\n   - Count: 14\n\n2. **Second Pathway**\n   - Node: \"Missed Shot\"\n   - Count: 9\n\n3. **Third Pathway**\n   - Node: \"Missed Shot\"\n   - Count: 14\n\n4. **Fourth Pathway**\n   - Node: \"Missed Shot\"\n   - Count: 9\n\n5. **Fifth Pathway**\n   - Node: \"Missed Shot\"\n   - Count: 6\n\n6. **Sixth Pathway**\n   - Node: \"Missed Shot\"\n   - Count: 12\n\n### Step 2: Sum the counts of all \"Missed Shot\" nodes\nNow, we add up all the counts from the \"Missed Shot\" nodes:\n\n\\[\n14 + 9 + 14 + 9 + 6 + 12 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the counts\nEach count represents the number of sequences that reached the \"Missed Shot\" node. Since the question asks for the total number of missed shots by both teams, we have accounted for all relevant nodes and their counts.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>64</answer>",
