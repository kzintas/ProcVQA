  "question": "How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "9",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about rebounds made after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UMD Offense\" is a node that has outgoing links to other nodes.\n- We need to look for a link from \"UMD Offense\" to a node labeled \"Rebound.\"\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- Starting from the \"UMD Offense\" node, we see it has three outgoing links:\n  - One link to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 8.\n  - One link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 16.\n  - One link to \"Foul\" with a count of 7.\n\n- From the \"Missed Shot\" node (which is directly connected to \"UMD Offense\"), there is a link to the \"Rebound\" node with a count of 9.\n\n### 3. Interpret the counts:\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of 9. This indicates that 9 sequences involved a rebound after a missed shot during UMD's offense.\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- The question specifically asks for rebounds after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The only path leading to a \"Rebound\" node from \"UMD Offense\" goes through \"Missed Shot.\"\n- The count on the link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" is 9, which represents the number of times a rebound occurred after a missed shot during UMD's offense.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>9</answer>",
