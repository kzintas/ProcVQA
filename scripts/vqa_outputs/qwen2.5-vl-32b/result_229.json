  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing events and directed links showing transitions between events.\n- Events related to free throws are not explicitly labeled as \"Free Throw\" in the diagram. However, free throws are typically associated with fouls.\n- We need to look for pathways involving \"Foul\" and subsequent \"Made Shot\" events that could represent free throws.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Diagram\n#### Pathway Involving Fouls:\n- There is a node labeled \"Foul\" with a count of 15, which is part of the pathway starting from `_Start` \u2192 `UNC Offense` \u2192 `Foul`.\n- After the \"Foul,\" the next event is `UMD Offense` with a count of 11.\n- From `UMD Offense`, there is a transition to `Made Shot` with a count of 7.\n\n#### Interpretation:\n- The \"Foul\" leads to `UMD Offense`, which suggests that UMD gets possession after the foul.\n- The `Made Shot` following `UMD Offense` could represent a free throw made by UMD, as it is the most logical interpretation given the context of a foul leading to free throw opportunities.\n\n### 3. Counting Free Throws\n- The link from `UMD Offense` to `Made Shot` has a count of 7.\n- This count (7) likely represents the number of free throws made by UMD after gaining possession following a foul.\n\n### 4. Reasoning Summary\n- The pathway `_Start` \u2192 `UNC Offense` \u2192 `Foul` \u2192 `UMD Offense` \u2192 `Made Shot` indicates that UMD made shots after gaining possession due to a foul.\n- The count of 7 on the link from `UMD Offense` to `Made Shot` is the most reasonable representation of free throws made by UMD.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>7</answer>",
