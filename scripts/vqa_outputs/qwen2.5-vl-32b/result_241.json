  "full_response": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to identify all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" and sum the counts associated with them. Let's analyze the diagram step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all \"Made Shot\" nodes\n- **First Pathway (leftmost):**\n  - Node: \"Made Shot\"\n  - Count: 2\n\n- **Second Pathway:**\n  - Node: \"Made Shot\"\n  - Count: 7\n\n- **Third Pathway:**\n  - Node: \"Made Shot\"\n  - Count: 3\n\n- **Fourth Pathway:**\n  - Node: \"Made Shot\"\n  - Count: 17\n\n### Step 2: Sum the counts of all \"Made Shot\" nodes\nNow, we add up the counts from all the \"Made Shot\" nodes:\n- 2 (from the first pathway)\n- 7 (from the second pathway)\n- 3 (from the third pathway)\n- 17 (from the fourth pathway)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total\n\\[ 2 + 7 + 3 + 17 = 29 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>29</answer>",
