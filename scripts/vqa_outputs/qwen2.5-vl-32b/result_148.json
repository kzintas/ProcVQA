  "question": "How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The node labeled **\"UMD Offense\"** is the focal point since we are asked about events immediately after it.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two outgoing links:\n  - One link leads to the node labeled **\"Rebound\"** with a count of **34**.\n  - Another link leads directly to the node labeled **\"_Exit\"** with a count of **35**.\n\n### 2. Interpret the meaning of the links:\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" suggests that after the UMD offense, a rebound occurred. This implies that a shot was missed because a rebound typically occurs when a shot does not go in.\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"_Exit\" suggests that the sequence ended without a rebound, which could mean the offense resulted in a score or another outcome that did not involve a missed shot.\n\n### 3. Determine the number of missed shots:\n- The question asks specifically about shots missed immediately after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The only pathway indicating a missed shot is the one leading to \"Rebound,\" as rebounds occur after missed shots.\n- The count on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is **34**.\n\n### 4. Final reasoning:\n- The number of missed shots immediately after \"UMD Offense\" is represented by the count on the link to \"Rebound.\"\n- No other pathway from \"UMD Offense\" indicates a missed shot.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>34</answer>",
