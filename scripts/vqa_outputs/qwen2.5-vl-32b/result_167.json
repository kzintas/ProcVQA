  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\n- The question asks about the number of steals that occurred after the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n- In the diagram, \"UMD Offense\" is a node with outgoing directed links.\n- We need to look for a link labeled \"Steal\" that originates from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n- The numeric label on the link will indicate the count of sequences that follow that path.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node and its outgoing links\n- The \"UMD Offense\" node is clearly visible in the diagram.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are several outgoing links:\n  - To \"Foul\" (count: 7)\n  - To \"Rebound\" (count: 27)\n  - To \"Made Free Throw\" (count: 8)\n  - To \"Missed Shot\" (count: 16)\n  - To \"Steal\" (count: 4)\n\n### Step 3: Identify the link labeled \"Steal\"\n- Among the outgoing links from \"UMD Offense,\" there is a link labeled \"Steal.\"\n- The numeric label on this link is **4**.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the count\n- The numeric label on the \"Steal\" link indicates that there are 4 sequences where a steal occurred after \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 5: Verify and conclude\n- The question specifically asks for the number of steals after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The diagram explicitly shows this information with the link labeled \"Steal\" and the count of 4.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>4</answer>",
