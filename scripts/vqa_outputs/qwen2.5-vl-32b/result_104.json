  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify the pathway in the diagram that leads to \"Discharge-Alive\" after going through the \"Floor\" node. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and links:\n- The \"Floor\" node is present in two pathways:\n  - In the third column from the left, where 23 patients go to \"Floor.\"\n  - In the fourth column from the left, where 27 patients go to \"Floor.\"\n\n- From the \"Floor\" node, we need to trace the path to \"Discharge-Alive\":\n  - In the third column, 20 patients go from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n  - In the fourth column, all 27 patients go directly from \"Floor\" to \"_Exit,\" not to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### 2. Analyze the connections:\n- The only valid pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" after going to \"Floor\" is in the third column.\n- In this column, 23 patients reach the \"Floor\" node, and out of these, 20 patients proceed to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### 3. Summarize the findings:\n- The total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is the sum of patients who follow the valid pathway.\n- From the analysis, only the third column contributes to this count, with 20 patients.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>20</answer>",
