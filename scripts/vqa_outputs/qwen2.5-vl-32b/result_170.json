  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n- We need to trace the pathways starting from \"UNC Offense\" and identify where \"Made Shot\" occurs before reaching \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### 2. Trace the pathways:\n#### Starting from \"UNC Offense\":\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" there are two primary paths:\n  1. **Path 1**: UNC Offense \u2192 Made Shot\n     - The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a count of **22**.\n  2. **Path 2**: UNC Offense \u2192 Missed Shot\n     - The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of **9**.\n\n#### Following Path 1 (UNC Offense \u2192 Made Shot):\n- After \"Made Shot,\" the next node is \"_Exit.\"\n- This path does not involve \"UMD Offense,\" so it satisfies the condition of being after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The count for this path is **22**.\n\n#### Following Path 2 (UNC Offense \u2192 Missed Shot):\n- After \"Missed Shot,\" the next nodes are:\n  - Rebound (count: 15)\n  - Foul (count: 8)\n- From \"Rebound,\" the next node is \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From \"Foul,\" the next node is also \"UMD Offense.\"\n- In both cases, \"UMD Offense\" is reached, so this path does not satisfy the condition of being before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### 3. Count the valid \"Made Shot\" events:\n- The only valid pathway that meets the criteria is the one directly from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" to \"_Exit.\"\n- The count for this pathway is **22**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>22</answer>",
