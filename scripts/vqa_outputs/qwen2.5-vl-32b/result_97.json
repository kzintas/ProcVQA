  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify the pathway in the diagram that leads to \"Discharge-Alive\" after going through the \"Floor\" node. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathways:\n- The diagram shows multiple pathways starting from `_Start` and leading to different outcomes.\n- We are specifically interested in the pathway that includes the \"Floor\" node and ends at \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway involving \"Floor\":\n- From the diagram, we can see that the \"Floor\" node is present in two pathways:\n  - One pathway leads to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n  - Another pathway leads to \"Die.\"\n\n### 3. Focus on the \"Floor\" \u2192 \"Discharge-Alive\" pathway:\n- In the third column of the diagram, we see a pathway where:\n  - `_Start` \u2192 `Arrival` \u2192 `Emergency` \u2192 `Floor` \u2192 `Discharge-Alive`.\n- The link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of **20**.\n\n### 4. Verify if there are other pathways:\n- In the fourth column, there is another \"Floor\" node, but it leads directly to \"Die,\" not \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n- Therefore, the only relevant pathway for \"Discharge-Alive\" after \"Floor\" is the one in the third column.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\n- The total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is explicitly shown as **20** in the diagram.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>20</answer>",
