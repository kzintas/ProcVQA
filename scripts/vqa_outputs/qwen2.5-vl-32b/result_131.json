  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- **Starting Point**: The diagram begins with the \"Start\" node, which transitions to \"UNC Offense.\"\n- **Focus Node**: The \"UMD Offense\" node is the primary focus since the question asks about UMD Offense.\n- **Outgoing Links from UMD Offense**:\n  - A link to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n  - A link to \"_Exit\" with a count of 21.\n  - A link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n\n### 2. Understand the question:\nThe question asks how many times UMD Offense did **not** transition to a Rebound. This means we need to sum up all the sequences where UMD Offense transitions to anything other than \"Rebound.\"\n\n### 3. Analyze the transitions:\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are three possible transitions:\n  1. To \"Rebound\": 34 sequences.\n  2. To \"_Exit\": 21 sequences.\n  3. To \"Missed Shot\": 14 sequences.\n\n- The total number of sequences starting from \"UMD Offense\" is the sum of all outgoing links:\n  \\[\n  34 + 21 + 14 = 69\n  \\]\n\n- To find the number of sequences where UMD Offense did not transition to \"Rebound,\" we subtract the number of sequences that went to \"Rebound\" from the total:\n  \\[\n  69 - 34 = 35\n  \\]\n\n### 4. Verify the calculation:\n- Total sequences from \"UMD Offense\": 69.\n- Sequences transitioning to \"Rebound\": 34.\n- Sequences not transitioning to \"Rebound\": \\(69 - 34 = 35\\).\n\nThis matches the sum of the sequences going to \"_Exit\" (21) and \"Missed Shot\" (14):\n\\[\n21 + 14 = 35\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
