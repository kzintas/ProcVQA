  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about shots made directly after a \"Rebound.\"\n- In the diagram, \"Rebound\" is a node.\n- We need to look at the links originating from the \"Rebound\" node and identify any link leading to a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n### 2. Examine the \"Rebound\" node:\n- The \"Rebound\" node has two outgoing links:\n  1. A link to \"Made Shot\" with a count of **15**.\n  2. A link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of **9**.\n\n### 3. Determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound:\n- The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" indicates that **15 sequences** ended in a \"Made Shot\" directly after a rebound.\n- The other link from \"Rebound\" to \"Missed Shot\" is irrelevant to the question since it does not represent a made shot.\n\n### 4. Final calculation:\n- The number of shots made directly after a Rebound is explicitly shown as **15**.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The \"Rebound\" node has two outgoing paths.\n- One path leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n- This count represents the number of sequences where a shot was made directly after a rebound.\n- No other path from \"Rebound\" leads to a \"Made Shot,\" so the count of 15 is the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>15</answer>",
