A path leading to `ICU` with a link labeled `62`.\n  2. A path leading directly to `Discharge-Alive` with a link labeled `38`.\n\n### Step 2: Trace the pathway leading to death\n- From the `ICU` node, there are two outgoing paths:\n  1. A path leading to `Die` with a link labeled `36`.\n  2. A path leading to `Floor` with a link labeled `24`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of patients who died\n- The number of patients who entered `ICU` is `62`.\n- Out of these, `36` patients followed the path leading to `Die`.\n- Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at `Emergency` is the same as the number of patients who followed the path from `ICU` to `Die`.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the total patient count\n- The total number of patients starting at `_Start` is `100`.\n- After arriving at `Emergency`, `62` patients went to `ICU`, and `38` patients were discharged alive.\n- From `ICU`, `36` patients died, and `24` patients moved to `Floor`.\n- From `Floor`, all `24` patients were discharged alive.\n- Adding up all the outcomes:\n  - Died: `36`\n  - Discharged Alive (directly from Emergency): `38`\n  - Discharged Alive (via Floor): `24`\n  - Total: `36 + 38 + 24 = 98`\n\nThe discrepancy of `2` patients can be attributed to rounding or minor errors in the visualization, but it does not affect the calculation for the number of patients who died.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>36</answer>",

We need to check each one to see if it leads to the Floor.\n- The ICU nodes are labeled with counts next to them, indicating the number of sequences that reach that node.\n\n#### ICU Node 1 (Leftmost column):\n- This ICU node has a count of **12**.\n- From this ICU node, there is a link leading to the **Die** node, but no link leading to the **Floor** node.\n- Therefore, none of the 12 sequences from this ICU node go to the Floor.\n\n#### ICU Node 2 (Second column from the left):\n- This ICU node has a count of **37**.\n- From this ICU node, there is a link leading directly to the **Discharge-Alive** node, but no link leading to the **Floor** node.\n- Therefore, none of the 37 sequences from this ICU node go to the Floor.\n\n#### ICU Node 3 (Third column from the left):\n- This ICU node has a count of **23**.\n- From this ICU node, there is a link leading to the **Floor** node.\n- The link from ICU to Floor is labeled with a count of **23**, which matches the count of sequences reaching the ICU node.\n- Therefore, all 23 sequences from this ICU node go to the Floor.\n\n#### ICU Node 4 (Rightmost column):\n- This ICU node has a count of **24**.\n- From this ICU node, there is a link leading to the **Floor** node.\n- The link from ICU to Floor is labeled with a count of **24**, which matches the count of sequences reaching the ICU node.\n- Therefore, all 24 sequences from this ICU node go to the Floor.\n\n### 3. Summarize the results:\n- From the analysis above:\n  - The ICU node in the third column sends **23** sequences to the Floor.\n  - The ICU node in the rightmost column sends **24** sequences to the Floor.\n- No other ICU nodes send sequences to the Floor.\n\n### 4. Calculate the total:\n- Total sequences going from ICU to Floor = **23 + 24 = 47**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>47</answer>",

    "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the total number of rebounds made by UMD Offense.\n- In the diagram, \"Rebound\" is a node that follows the \"Missed Shot\" node under the \"UMD Offense\" branch.\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" has a numeric label indicating the count of sequences.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- Start at the \"_Start\" node, which leads to \"UNC Offense\" and then to \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there is a link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14 sequences.\n- From \"Missed Shot,\" there is a link to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 sequences.\n\n### 3. Interpret the counts:\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with the number 34. This indicates that out of the 14 sequences that reached \"Missed Shot,\" 34 sequences resulted in a rebound.\n- However, this seems inconsistent because the number of sequences leading to \"Missed Shot\" (14) cannot logically result in more sequences (34) leading to \"Rebound.\" This suggests a potential error or misinterpretation in the visualization.\n\n### 4. Re-evaluate the context:\n- Given the structure of the diagram, it's possible that the link width or label might be misinterpreted. Typically, the number on a link represents the count of sequences following that path.\n- If we assume the label 34 is correct, it would imply an anomaly since it exceeds the incoming sequence count (14). Without additional context, we must rely on the explicit values shown.\n\n### 5. Final reasoning:\n- The diagram explicitly shows a link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" labeled with 34. Even though this number exceeds the incoming sequence count (14), we must accept the value as presented unless otherwise clarified.\n- Therefore, based on the visualization, the total number of rebounds made by UMD Offense is represented by the label on the link to \"Rebound.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>34</answer>",

    "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and leading to various outcomes.\n- The node `UMD Offense` is the primary focus, as it represents the UMD team's offensive plays.\n- From `UMD Offense`, there are several pathways leading to different outcomes:\n  - `Rebound` (34 sequences)\n  - `Missed Shot` (14 sequences)\n  - `Foul` (8 sequences)\n  - `Made Shot` (3 sequences)\n  - `_Exit` (implying the end of a sequence without a specific outcome)\n\n### 2. Understand the context of free throws:\n- Free throws are typically associated with fouls in basketball. Therefore, we need to focus on the `Foul` node.\n- From the `Foul` node, there is a link to `_Exit` with a count of 10 sequences. This suggests that after a foul, the sequence ends, which could imply free throws were made (since fouls often lead to free throws).\n\n### 3. Analyze the `Foul` node:\n- The `Foul` node has a total of 8 sequences leading into it from `UMD Offense`.\n- All 8 sequences from `Foul` lead to `_Exit`, with a count of 10 sequences. This discrepancy (8 vs. 10) suggests that the 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws made after fouls.\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- The `Foul` node indicates that 8 sequences involve fouls.\n- The 10 sequences leading from `Foul` to `_Exit` suggest that these 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws made after fouls.\n- Since the question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we can conclude that the 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>10</answer>",

    "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total shots were made by UMD offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The **UMD Offense** node is a key starting point.\n- From **UMD Offense**, there are two outgoing links:\n  - One leads to **Rebound** with a count of **34**.\n  - Another leads directly to **_Exit** with a count of **21**.\n- The **Rebound** node further splits into two paths:\n  - One leads to **Made Shot** with a count of **15**.\n  - Another leads directly to **_Exit** with a count of **19**.\n\n### 2. Understand the Question\nWe need to determine the total number of shots made by UMD during their offensive possessions. A \"shot\" in this context can be interpreted as any sequence that results in a **Made Shot** or a **Missed Shot**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Pathways\n#### Pathway 1: UMD Offense \u2192 Rebound \u2192 Made Shot\n- The link from **UMD Offense** to **Rebound** has a count of **34**.\n- From **Rebound**, **15** sequences lead to **Made Shot**.\n- Therefore, **15** shots were made after a rebound.\n\n#### Pathway 2: UMD Offense \u2192 Missed Shot\n- The link from **UMD Offense** directly to **_Exit** (via **Missed Shot**) has a count of **21**.\n- These **21** sequences represent missed shots because they do not go through the **Rebound** node and instead exit directly.\n\n### 4. Calculate Total Shots Made\n- **Shots made after a rebound**: **15**.\n- **Missed shots**: **21**.\n- Total shots = Shots made + Missed shots = **15 + 21 = 36**.\n\n### 5. Verify Completeness\n- All sequences originating from **UMD Offense** are accounted for:\n  - **34** sequences go to **Rebound**.\n  - **21** sequences go directly to **_Exit**.\n  - Total sequences from **UMD Offense**: **34 + 21 = 55**.\n- This matches the total number of sequences leaving **UMD Offense**, confirming our analysis is complete.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>36</answer>",

Identify Relevant Elements:\n- The **\"Missed Shot\"** node is directly connected to the **\"Rebound\"** node.\n- The **\"Rebound\"** node has two outgoing paths: one leading to **\"UNC Offense\"** and another leading to **\"UMD Offense.\"**\n- The link from **\"Rebound\"** to **\"UMD Offense\"** has a numeric label of **35**, indicating that 35 sequences followed this path.\n\n### 2. Understand the Pathway:\n- The question asks how many **missed shots** occurred before the **UMD Offense**.\n- To determine this, we need to trace the pathway leading to **UMD Offense** and identify the number of missed shots involved.\n- The **\"Missed Shot\"** node is part of the pathway leading to **UMD Offense**. Specifically, it is the immediate predecessor of the **\"Rebound\"** node, which then leads to **UMD Offense.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the Link Counts:\n- The link from **\"Rebound\"** to **\"UMD Offense\"** has a count of **35**. This means that 35 sequences reached **UMD Offense** after a rebound.\n- Since the **\"Missed Shot\"** node is the direct predecessor of **\"Rebound,\"** all 35 sequences that reached **UMD Offense** must have originated from a **missed shot.**\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- Every sequence that reaches **UMD Offense** via the **\"Rebound\"** node must have gone through a **\"Missed Shot\"** before reaching **Rebound.**\n- Therefore, the number of **missed shots** before **UMD Offense** is equal to the number of sequences that reached **UMD Offense** via the **\"Rebound\"** node, which is **35.**\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",

Examine the counts associated with each Rebound node:\n- **Left Rebound Node**:\n  - The link leading to this node has a count of **19**.\n  - This indicates that there were 19 rebounds made by UNC after a missed shot.\n- **Right Rebound Node**:\n  - The link leading to this node has a count of **15**.\n  - This indicates that there were 15 rebounds made by UMD after a missed shot.\n\n### 3. Sum the total rebounds:\n- Total rebounds = Rebounds by UNC + Rebounds by UMD\n- Total rebounds = 19 (UNC) + 15 (UMD)\n- Total rebounds = 34\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe rebounds are explicitly shown as nodes in the diagram, and the counts on the links leading to these nodes represent the number of times each team rebounded the ball. By summing these counts, we can determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>34</answer>",

Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing events and directed links showing transitions between events.\n- Events related to free throws are not explicitly labeled as \"Free Throw\" in the diagram. However, free throws are typically associated with fouls.\n- We need to look for pathways involving \"Foul\" and subsequent \"Made Shot\" events that could represent free throws.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Diagram\n#### Pathway Involving Fouls:\n- There is a node labeled \"Foul\" with a count of 15, which is part of the pathway starting from `_Start` \u2192 `UNC Offense` \u2192 `Foul`.\n- After the \"Foul,\" the next event is `UMD Offense` with a count of 11.\n- From `UMD Offense`, there is a transition to `Made Shot` with a count of 7.\n\n#### Interpretation:\n- The \"Foul\" leads to `UMD Offense`, which suggests that UMD gets possession after the foul.\n- The `Made Shot` following `UMD Offense` could represent a free throw made by UMD, as it is the most logical interpretation given the context of a foul leading to free throw opportunities.\n\n### 3. Counting Free Throws\n- The link from `UMD Offense` to `Made Shot` has a count of 7.\n- This count (7) likely represents the number of free throws made by UMD after gaining possession following a foul.\n\n### 4. Reasoning Summary\n- The pathway `_Start` \u2192 `UNC Offense` \u2192 `Foul` \u2192 `UMD Offense` \u2192 `Made Shot` indicates that UMD made shots after gaining possession due to a foul.\n- The count of 7 on the link from `UMD Offense` to `Made Shot` is the most reasonable representation of free throws made by UMD.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>7</answer>",

    "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" occurred after \"UNC Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UNC Offense\" is represented as a node with a specific color (orange) and label.\n- We need to look for directed links from \"UNC Offense\" nodes to \"Jump Ball\" nodes.\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways:\n- Starting from the \"Start\" node, we see that there are two sequences leading to \"UNC Offense\" (with counts 2 and 14).\n- From the \"UNC Offense\" nodes, we need to trace the links to see if any lead to \"Jump Ball.\"\n\n### 3. Trace the links:\n- The first \"UNC Offense\" node (count 2) does not have a link to \"Jump Ball.\" Instead, it leads to \"Missed Shot.\"\n- The second \"UNC Offense\" node (count 14) also does not have a direct link to \"Jump Ball.\" Instead, it leads to \"Rebound.\"\n\n### 4. Check for any indirect paths:\n- There are no indirect paths from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" in the diagram. The \"Jump Ball\" node is only reachable from the \"Start\" node, not from any \"UNC Offense\" node.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\n- Based on the diagram, there are no sequences where a \"Jump Ball\" occurs after \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>0</answer>",

Identify Relevant Elements\n- We need to focus on the pathways involving \"UMD Offense\" and specifically look for links leading to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n- The diagram shows sequences of events, with link widths and numeric labels indicating the number of sequences following each path.\n\n### 2. Trace the Pathways Involving \"UMD Offense\"\n- Starting from the \"Start\" node, we see multiple branches leading to different events.\n- One of these branches leads to \"UMD Offense,\" which is colored in gray.\n\n#### Pathway Analysis:\n- From \"Start,\" there are several paths leading to \"UMD Offense.\" We need to follow these paths to see if any lead to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n##### Path 1: Direct Path to \"UMD Offense\"\n- From \"Start,\" there is a direct path to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 9 sequences.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there is a link to \"Made Shot\" (purple) with a count of 17 sequences.\n- There is no direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\" in this pathway.\n\n##### Path 2: Through \"Missed Shot\"\n- Another path from \"Start\" goes through \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Missed Shot\" \u2192 \"Rebound\" \u2192 \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From \"UMD Offense\" in this pathway, there is a link to \"Made Free Throw\" (cyan) with a count of 6 sequences.\n\n##### Path 3: Through \"Foul\"\n- Another path from \"Start\" goes through \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Foul\" \u2192 \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From \"UMD Offense\" in this pathway, there is a link to \"Made Free Throw\" (cyan) with a count of 10 sequences.\n\n### 3. Summarize the Counts of \"Made Free Throw\" for UMD Offense\n- From the analysis above, we see two pathways where \"UMD Offense\" leads to \"Made Free Throw\":\n  1. Path through \"Rebound\": 6 sequences\n  2. Path through \"Foul\": 10 sequences\n\n- Adding these counts together:\n  \\[\n  6 + 10 = 16\n  \\]\n\n### 4.
