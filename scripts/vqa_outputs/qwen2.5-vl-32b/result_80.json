  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathway:\n- The question asks about patients who were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n- We need to look for a direct path from the \"Arrival\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node without any intermediate steps.\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways:\n- Starting from the \"Arrival\" node, we see that there are multiple paths leading to different nodes.\n- For each \"Arrival\" node, we need to check if there is a direct link to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n#### Pathway 1: Top-left branch\n- **Arrival (12)** \u2192 **Emergency (12)** \u2192 **ICU (12)** \u2192 **Die (12)**\n  - There is no direct link from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" in this branch.\n\n#### Pathway 2: Top-middle branch\n- **Arrival (37)** \u2192 **Emergency (37)** \u2192 **Discharge-Alive (37)**\n  - Here, there is a direct link from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a count of 37.\n\n#### Pathway 3: Top-right branch\n- **Arrival (24)** \u2192 **Emergency (24)** \u2192 **ICU (23)** \u2192 **Floor (23)** \u2192 **Discharge-Alive (20)**\n  - There is no direct link from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" in this branch.\n\n#### Pathway 4: Far-right branch\n- **Arrival (27)** \u2192 **Emergency (27)** \u2192 **Floor (27)** \u2192 **ICU (24)** \u2192 **Die (18)**\n  - There is no direct link from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" in this branch.\n\n### 3. Count the patients:\n- From the analysis above, only the top-middle branch has a direct link from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n- The count of sequences for this direct link is **37**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>37</answer>",
