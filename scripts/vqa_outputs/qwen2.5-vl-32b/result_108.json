  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathway:\n- The question asks about patients who were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n- We need to look for a direct path from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" and then to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- **Start**: The diagram begins with `_Start`.\n- **Arrival**: From `_Start`, there is a link to \"Arrival.\"\n- **Emergency**: From \"Arrival,\" there is a link to \"Emergency.\"\n- **Discharge-Alive**: From \"Emergency,\" we need to check if there is a direct link to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### 3. Check the specific path:\n- From \"Emergency,\" there is a direct link to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n- The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of **37**.\n\n### 4. Verify the sequence:\n- The sequence \"Arrival \u2192 Emergency \u2192 Discharge-Alive\" matches the requirement of being discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n- The count of sequences following this path is explicitly shown as **37**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency is **37**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>37</answer>",
