  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to identify all the \"Missed Shot\" nodes in the diagram and sum their corresponding sequence counts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify \"Missed Shot\" Nodes:**\n   - There are three \"Missed Shot\" nodes in the diagram:\n     1. The first \"Missed Shot\" node is connected to \"Rebound\" with a count of 19.\n     2. The second \"Missed Shot\" node is connected to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 18.\n     3. The third \"Missed Shot\" node is connected to \"Foul\" with a count of 15.\n\n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - The count for the first \"Missed Shot\" node is 19.\n   - The count for the second \"Missed Shot\" node is 18.\n   - The count for the third \"Missed Shot\" node is 15.\n\n   Adding these counts together:\n   \\[\n   19 + 18 + 15 = 52\n   \\]\n\n### Reasoning:\n- Each \"Missed Shot\" node represents a sequence where a shot was missed.\n- The numeric labels next to the links indicate the number of sequences that follow that path.\n- By summing the counts of all \"Missed Shot\" nodes, we get the total number of missed shots made by both teams.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>52</answer>",
