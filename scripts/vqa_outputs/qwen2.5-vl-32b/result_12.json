  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and pathways:\n- The starting point is `_Start`, which leads to `Arrival` (100 patients).\n- From `Arrival`, all patients proceed to `Emergency` (100 patients).\n- From `Emergency`, there are two main pathways:\n  - **Pathway 1**: 62 patients go to `ICU`.\n  - **Pathway 2**: 38 patients go directly to `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### 2. Follow the pathway from `Emergency` to `ICU`:\n- From `Emergency`, 62 patients go to `ICU`.\n- From `ICU`, there are two outcomes:\n  - **Outcome 1**: 36 patients die.\n  - **Outcome 2**: 24 patients go to `Floor`.\n\n### 3. Determine the number of patients who died:\n- The only direct path leading to death is from `ICU` to `Die`.\n- The number of patients who die is explicitly labeled as 36.\n\n### 4. Verify if there are any other paths leading to death:\n- There are no other paths in the diagram that lead directly to death from any other node.\n- All patients who die must pass through `ICU`.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- All patients start at `_Start` and arrive at `Emergency` (100 patients).\n- From `Emergency`, 62 patients go to `ICU`.\n- From `ICU`, 36 patients die.\n- No other nodes or pathways lead to death.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>36</answer>",
