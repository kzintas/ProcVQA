  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and pathways:\n- The diagram starts with the `_Start` node, which has 100 sequences.\n- From `_Start`, all patients proceed to the `Arrival` node, which also has 100 sequences.\n- From `Arrival`, all patients proceed to the `Emergency` node, which again has 100 sequences.\n- From `Emergency`, there are two pathways:\n  - 62 patients proceed to the `ICU` node.\n  - 38 patients proceed directly to the `Discharge-Alive` node.\n\n### 2. Follow the pathway from `Emergency` to `ICU`:\n- From the `ICU` node, there are two further pathways:\n  - 36 patients proceed to the `Die` node.\n  - 26 patients proceed to the `_Exit` node.\n\n### 3. Determine the number of patients who died:\n- The `Die` node is directly connected to the `ICU` node.\n- The number of patients who died is explicitly labeled as 36 on the link from `ICU` to `Die`.\n\n### 4. Verify the total flow:\n- The total number of patients who entered the `Emergency` node is 100.\n- 62 patients went to `ICU`, and 38 patients went directly to `Discharge-Alive`.\n- From `ICU`, 36 patients died, and 26 patients exited.\n- The total flow is consistent: \\(62 = 36 + 26\\).\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at the `Emergency` node. The diagram shows that 62 patients went from `Emergency` to `ICU`, and out of those, 36 patients proceeded to the `Die` node. Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at `Emergency` is 36.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>36</answer>",
