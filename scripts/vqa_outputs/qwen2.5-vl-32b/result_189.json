  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify Relevant Elements\n- The question asks about the number of rebounds made after the \"UMD Offense\" event.\n- In the diagram:\n  - \"UMD Offense\" is a node with two outgoing links labeled \"Rebound\" and \"_Exit.\"\n  - The link to \"Rebound\" has a numeric label of **34**, indicating the number of sequences that follow this path.\n  - The link to \"_Exit\" has a numeric label of **22**, indicating the number of sequences that follow this path.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Pathway\n- The \"UMD Offense\" node represents an event where the UMD team is on offense.\n- After \"UMD Offense,\" there are two possible outcomes:\n  1. A rebound occurs, leading to the \"Rebound\" node.\n  2. The sequence ends with \"_Exit,\" indicating no further action from UMD.\n- The number of rebounds is directly represented by the count on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound.\"\n\n### Step 3: Extract the Count\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is explicitly labeled with the number **34**.\n- This means that in 34 sequences, a rebound occurred after the UMD offense.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Completeness\n- The diagram shows all possible paths originating from \"UMD Offense.\"\n- There are no other hidden or indirect paths involving rebounds that need to be considered.\n- The count of 34 is the only relevant value for rebounds after \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>34</answer>",
