  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total shots were made by UMD offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and leading to various outcomes.\n- The node labeled `UMD Offense` is the starting point for UMD's offensive actions.\n- From `UMD Offense`, there are three primary pathways:\n  - `Rebound` (34 sequences)\n  - `Missed Shot` (14 sequences)\n  - `Foul` (8 sequences)\n  - `Made Shot` (3 sequences)\n\n### 2. Focus on Made Shots\n- The question specifically asks about **made shots** by UMD offense.\n- In the diagram, the pathway leading directly to `Made Shot` has a count of **3 sequences**.\n- Additionally, there is another pathway where UMD takes a rebound and subsequently makes a shot:\n  - From `Rebound` (34 sequences), there is a branch leading to `Made Shot` with a count of **15 sequences**.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Made Shots\n- Direct `Made Shot` from `UMD Offense`: 3 sequences\n- `Made Shot` after `Rebound`: 15 sequences\n\nTotal made shots = 3 + 15 = 18\n\n### 4. Reasoning Summary\n- The total number of made shots by UMD offense is the sum of all paths leading to `Made Shot`.\n- These paths include:\n  1. Directly from `UMD Offense` to `Made Shot` (3 sequences).\n  2. From `Rebound` to `Made Shot` (15 sequences).\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>18</answer>",
