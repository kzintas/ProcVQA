  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to identify all the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and sum the counts associated with the links leading to or from these nodes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rebound Nodes:**\n   - There are two nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram:\n     - One under \"UNC Offense\"\n     - One under \"UMD Offense\"\n\n2. **Count the Links Associated with Each Rebound Node:**\n   - **Rebound under UNC Offense:**\n     - The link leading to this node has a count of **15**.\n     - The link leading from this node has a count of **15**.\n   - **Rebound under UMD Offense:**\n     - The link leading to this node has a count of **27**.\n     - The link leading from this node has a count of **4**.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - For the \"Rebound\" under UNC Offense:\n     - Total = 15 (in) + 15 (out) = 30\n   - For the \"Rebound\" under UMD Offense:\n     - Total = 27 (in) + 4 (out) = 31\n\n4. **Calculate the Grand Total:**\n   - Total rebounds = 30 (UNC) + 31 (UMD) = 61\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe rebounds are counted by summing the sequences entering and exiting each \"Rebound\" node. This ensures that all occurrences of rebounds are accounted for, regardless of whether they lead to further events or end the sequence.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>61</answer>",
