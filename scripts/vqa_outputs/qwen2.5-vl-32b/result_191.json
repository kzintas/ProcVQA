  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events with nodes and directed links.\n- Nodes represent events, and the labels on the nodes indicate the type of event.\n- Links show transitions between events, with widths proportional to the number of sequences following that path.\n- Numeric labels next to the links indicate the exact count of sequences.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Question\nWe need to determine how many \"Made Shot\" events occurred:\n1. After the \"UNC Offense\" event.\n2. Before the \"UMD Offense\" event.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pathways\n#### Path from \"UNC Offense\":\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" there are two outgoing paths:\n  1. **Made Shot** (count = 22)\n  2. **Missed Shot** (count = 24)\n\n#### Path from \"Made Shot\":\n- From \"Made Shot,\" there is one outgoing path:\n  - **Rebound** (count = 22)\n\n#### Path from \"Missed Shot\":\n- From \"Missed Shot,\" there is one outgoing path:\n  - **UMD Offense** (count = 24)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Sequence\n- The question asks for \"Made Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From the diagram:\n  - \"Made Shot\" directly follows \"UNC Offense.\"\n  - \"Made Shot\" leads to \"Rebound,\" which is not part of the \"UMD Offense\" pathway.\n  - No other \"Made Shot\" events occur before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 5: Count the Sequences\n- The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a count of **22**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>22</answer>",
