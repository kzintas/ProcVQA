  "full_response": "### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Diagram\nThe diagram is a node-link visualization that represents sequences of events. Here's what we can observe:\n- **Nodes**: Represent events, such as `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, and `_Exit`.\n- **Links**: Directed edges connecting nodes, indicating transitions between events.\n- **Link Widths**: Proportional to the number of sequences following that path.\n- **Numeric Labels on Links**: Show the exact count of sequences for each transition.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Nodes and Links\nTo answer the question, we need to focus on the transitions involving the `UMD Offense` node:\n- From `UMD Offense`, there are two outgoing links:\n  1. A link to `Rebound` with a count of **34**.\n  2. A link directly to `_Exit` with a count of **35**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks how many times `UMD Offense` did **not** transition to `Rebound`. This means we need to count the sequences where `UMD Offense` transitions to any other node (in this case, `_Exit`).\n\n### Step 4: Extract Relevant Data\nFrom the diagram:\n- The total number of sequences starting from `UMD Offense` is the sum of all outgoing links:\n  \\[\n  34 + 35 = 69\n  \\]\n- The number of sequences transitioning from `UMD Offense` to `Rebound` is **34**.\n- The number of sequences transitioning from `UMD Offense` to `_Exit` is **35**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Answer\nThe number of times `UMD Offense` did not transition to `Rebound` is the count of sequences transitioning to `_Exit`, which is **35**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
