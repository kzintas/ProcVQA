  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The starting point is `_Start`, which has 100 sequences.\n- From `_Start`, all patients proceed to `Arrival` (100 sequences).\n- From `Arrival`, patients proceed to `Emergency` (100 sequences).\n- From `Emergency`, there are two pathways:\n  - 41 patients go to `Floor`.\n  - 38 patients go directly to `Discharge-Alive` and then to `_Exit`.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway leading to death:\n- From `Emergency`, 41 patients go to `Floor`.\n- From `Floor`, there are two pathways:\n  - 24 patients go to `Discharge-Alive` and then to `_Exit`.\n  - 21 patients go to `ICU`.\n- From `ICU`, there are two pathways:\n  - 24 patients go to `Floor` and then to `Discharge-Alive` and `_Exit`.\n  - 36 patients go to `Die` and then to `_Exit`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the number of patients who died:\n- The only pathway leading to `Die` starts from `ICU`.\n- The number of patients who go from `ICU` to `Die` is 36.\n\n### 4. Verify the total flow:\n- From `Emergency`, 41 patients go to `Floor`.\n- From `Floor`, 21 patients go to `ICU`.\n- From `ICU`, 36 patients go to `Die`.\n- This accounts for all patients who died.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe number of patients who died after arriving at `Emergency` is the number of patients who followed the pathway from `Emergency` to `Floor` to `ICU` to `Die`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>36</answer>",
