  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\n- The question asks about the number of shots missed immediately after the \"UMD Offense\" event.\n- In the diagram, \"UMD Offense\" is a node with outgoing links to other nodes.\n- The link leading to the \"Missed Shot\" node represents the number of sequences where a shot was missed immediately after \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the link to \"Missed Shot\"\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a numeric label of **14**.\n- This label indicates that there are 14 sequences where a shot was missed immediately after \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 3: Verify other paths\n- Other outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" lead to \"Rebound\" (34 sequences), \"Foul\" (8 sequences), and \"Made Shot\" (3 sequences).\n- These paths do not involve a missed shot, so they are not relevant to the question.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the answer\n- The only path that directly answers the question is the link to \"Missed Shot,\" which has a count of 14.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>14</answer>",
