  "question": "How many missed shots were before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements:\n- The **\"Missed Shot\"** node is directly connected to the **\"Rebound\"** node.\n- The **\"Rebound\"** node has two outgoing paths: one leading to **\"UNC Offense\"** and another leading to **\"UMD Offense.\"**\n- The link from **\"Rebound\"** to **\"UMD Offense\"** has a numeric label of **35**, indicating that 35 sequences followed this path.\n\n### 2. Understand the Pathway:\n- The question asks how many **missed shots** occurred before the **UMD Offense**.\n- To determine this, we need to trace the pathway leading to **UMD Offense** and identify the number of missed shots involved.\n- The **\"Missed Shot\"** node is part of the pathway leading to **UMD Offense**. Specifically, it is the immediate predecessor of the **\"Rebound\"** node, which then leads to **UMD Offense.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the Link Counts:\n- The link from **\"Rebound\"** to **\"UMD Offense\"** has a count of **35**. This means that 35 sequences reached **UMD Offense** after a rebound.\n- Since the **\"Missed Shot\"** node is the direct predecessor of **\"Rebound,\"** all 35 sequences that reached **UMD Offense** must have originated from a **missed shot.**\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- Every sequence that reaches **UMD Offense** via the **\"Rebound\"** node must have gone through a **\"Missed Shot\"** before reaching **Rebound.**\n- Therefore, the number of **missed shots** before **UMD Offense** is equal to the number of sequences that reached **UMD Offense** via the **\"Rebound\"** node, which is **35.**\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
