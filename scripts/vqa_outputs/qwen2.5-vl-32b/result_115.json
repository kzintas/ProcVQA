  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to analyze the pathways originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node and determine how many times it did not transition to a \"Rebound.\"\n\n### Step 1: Identify the pathways from \"UMD Offense\"\nFrom the diagram, the \"UMD Offense\" node has two outgoing links:\n1. A link to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n2. A link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of sequences starting from \"UMD Offense\"\nThe total number of sequences starting from \"UMD Offense\" is indicated by the label next to the node, which is 69.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of sequences that transition to \"Rebound\"\nThe link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of 34. This means 34 sequences transitioned to \"Rebound.\"\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of sequences that did not transition to \"Rebound\"\nTo find the number of sequences that did not transition to \"Rebound,\" we subtract the number of sequences that transitioned to \"Rebound\" from the total number of sequences starting from \"UMD Offense\":\n\\[\n69 - 34 = 35\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the result\nThe remaining sequences (35) must have transitioned to other nodes, such as \"Missed Shot,\" which aligns with the link count of 14. This confirms our calculation is consistent with the diagram.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>35</answer>",
