  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- We need to focus on the pathways involving \"UMD Offense\" and specifically look for nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw.\"\n- The diagram shows sequences of events with directed links and numerical counts next to each link.\n\n### 2. Trace the Pathways Involving UMD Offense\n#### Pathway 1: From \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\"\n- Starting from the \"UMD Offense\" node (red label) in the third column:\n  - There is a link leading to \"Made Free Throw\" (yellow label).\n  - The count on this link is **13**.\n\n#### Pathway 2: From \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" to \"Made Free Throw\"\n- Starting from the \"UMD Offense\" node (red label) in the fourth column:\n  - There is a link leading to \"Foul\" (gray label).\n  - From \"Foul,\" there is a link leading to \"Made Free Throw\" (yellow label).\n  - The count on the link from \"Foul\" to \"Made Free Throw\" is **8**.\n\n### 3. Sum the Counts\n- From the first pathway: **13** free throws were made.\n- From the second pathway: **8** free throws were made.\n- Total free throws made by UMD Offense: \\( 13 + 8 = 21 \\).\n\n### 4. Verify Completeness\n- We have accounted for all pathways leading to \"Made Free Throw\" from \"UMD Offense.\"\n- No other pathways involving \"UMD Offense\" lead to \"Made Free Throw.\"\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>21</answer>",
