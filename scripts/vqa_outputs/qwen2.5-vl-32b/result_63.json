Here's a breakdown of the nodes and links:\n\n- **_Start**: The initial node with 100 patients.\n- **Arrival**: All 100 patients move to this node.\n- **Emergency**: From here, patients split into two paths:\n  - 62 patients go to **ICU**.\n  - 38 patients go to **Discharge-Alive**.\n- **ICU**: From this node, patients split into two paths:\n  - 36 patients go to **Die**.\n  - 26 patients go to **_Exit**.\n- **Discharge-Alive**: All 38 patients move to **_Exit**.\n- **Die**: All 36 patients move to **_Exit**.\n- **_Exit**: The final node where all patients end up.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Path to the Floor\nThe question asks how many patients went to the **Floor** after the ICU. However, there is no node explicitly labeled as \"Floor\" in the diagram. The only nodes directly connected to the ICU are:\n- **Die** (36 patients).\n- **_Exit** (26 patients).\n\nSince there is no node labeled \"Floor,\" we cannot determine how many patients went to the Floor based on the information provided in the diagram.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe diagram does not contain any information about a \"Floor\" node or any pathway leading to it. Therefore, it is impossible to answer the question based on the given visualization.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
