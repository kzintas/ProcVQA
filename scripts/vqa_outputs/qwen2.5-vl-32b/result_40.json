  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify the pathways that lead to \"Discharge-Alive\" after going through the \"Floor\" node and sum the counts of sequences for those pathways.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the starting point:**\n   - The diagram begins with the `_Start` node, which has 100 patients.\n\n2. **Trace the pathway to \"Floor\":**\n   - From `_Start`, all 100 patients proceed to \"Arrival.\"\n   - From \"Arrival,\" all 100 patients proceed to \"Emergency.\"\n   - From \"Emergency,\" there are two paths:\n     - 21 patients go to \"Floor.\"\n     - 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n3. **Focus on the \"Floor\" node:**\n   - 21 patients reach the \"Floor\" node.\n   - From \"Floor,\" there are two possible paths:\n     - 21 patients go to \"ICU.\"\n     - 8 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n4. **Identify the pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Floor\":**\n   - The direct path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has 8 patients.\n\n5. **Summarize the total patients discharged alive after going to the Floor:**\n   - Only the direct path from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" contributes to the count of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n   - The number of patients on this path is 8.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>8</answer>",
