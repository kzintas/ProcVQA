  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to analyze the node-link diagram and identify all pathways where the UNC offense results in a \"Made Shot.\" Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Nodes and Links\n- The diagram shows sequences starting with `_Start` and ending with `_Exit`.\n- We are interested in paths where the UNC offense leads directly to a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n### 2. Trace Pathways Involving UNC Offense\n#### Pathway 1:\n- Start: `_Start` (UNC Offense, count = 7)\n- Next: \"Missed Shot\" (count = 7)\n- Next: \"Rebound\" (count = 7)\n- Next: \"UMD Offense\" (count = 7)\n- This pathway does not involve a \"Made Shot\" by UNC.\n\n#### Pathway 2:\n- Start: `_Start` (UNC Offense, count = 14)\n- Next: \"Missed Shot\" (count = 14)\n- Next: \"Rebound\" (count = 14)\n- Next: \"UMD Offense\" (count = 14)\n- This pathway also does not involve a \"Made Shot\" by UNC.\n\n#### Pathway 3:\n- Start: `_Start` (UNC Offense, count = 15)\n- Next: \"Foul\" (count = 15)\n- Next: \"Made Free Throw\" (count = 13)\n- This pathway involves a \"Made Shot\" (free throw) by UNC.\n\n#### Pathway 4:\n- Start: `_Start` (UNC Offense, count = 5)\n- Next: \"Jump Ball\" (count = 1)\n- Next: \"UMD Offense\" (count = 5)\n- This pathway does not involve a \"Made Shot\" by UNC.\n\n#### Pathway 5:\n- Start: `_Start` (UNC Offense, count = 28)\n- Next: \"Made Shot\" (count = 16)\n- This pathway involves a \"Made Shot\" by UNC.\n\n### 3. Count the Made Shots by UNC Offense\n- From Pathway 3: \"Made Free Throw\" (count = 13)\n- From Pathway 5: \"Made Shot\" (count = 16)\n\n### 4. Sum the Counts\n- Total made shots by UNC offense = 13 (from Pathway 3) + 16 (from Pathway 5) = 29\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>29</answer>",
