  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to identify all pathways in the diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node and sum the counts associated with those pathways.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify all occurrences of \"Discharge-Alive\":**\n   - There are two instances of the \"Discharge-Alive\" node in the diagram:\n     1. In the second column (middle-left section).\n     2. In the fourth column (right section).\n\n2. **Examine the first \"Discharge-Alive\" node:**\n   - This node is directly connected to the \"Emergency\" node above it.\n   - The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of **37**.\n   - Therefore, 37 patients were discharged alive via this pathway.\n\n3. **Examine the second \"Discharge-Alive\" node:**\n   - This node is directly connected to the \"Floor\" node above it.\n   - The link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of **20**.\n   - Therefore, 20 patients were discharged alive via this pathway.\n\n4. **Sum the counts:**\n   - Total patients discharged alive = 37 (from the first \"Discharge-Alive\") + 20 (from the second \"Discharge-Alive\").\n   - Total = 37 + 20 = 57.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>57</answer>",
