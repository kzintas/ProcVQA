  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify Relevant Elements in the Visualization\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at various outcomes.\n- Nodes represent events, and directed links show the flow of sequences between events.\n- Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path, and numeric labels on the links indicate the exact count of sequences.\n- The question asks about the number of patients who went to the \"Floor\" after the ICU. However, there is no node explicitly labeled \"Floor\" in the diagram. Instead, we see nodes such as `ICU`, `_Exit`, `Die`, and `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Pathways Involving the ICU\n- From the `_Start` node, all patients proceed to `Arrival` (100 patients).\n- From `Arrival`, all patients proceed to `Emergency` (100 patients).\n- From `Emergency`, patients split into two paths:\n  - **Path 1**: 62 patients go to `ICU`.\n  - **Path 2**: 38 patients go directly to `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### Step 3: Examine the Outcomes from the ICU\n- From the `ICU` node, there are two outgoing paths:\n  - **Path 1**: 36 patients go to `Die`.\n  - **Path 2**: 26 patients go to `_Exit`.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question\n- The question asks about patients going to the \"Floor\" after the ICU. However, there is no explicit \"Floor\" node in the diagram. The only possible interpretation is that the \"_Exit\" node might represent patients moving to a general floor or being discharged.\n- If we assume `_Exit` represents the \"Floor,\" then the number of patients going to the \"Floor\" after the ICU is the number of patients flowing from `ICU` to `_Exit`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Number of Patients\n- The link from `ICU` to `_Exit` is labeled with the number 26. This indicates that 26 patients went to `_Exit` after the ICU.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>26</answer>",
