  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to identify all the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and sum their associated counts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rebound Nodes:**\n   - There are two nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n   - The first \"Rebound\" node is connected from \"Missed Shot\" (count 25) and has a count of 26.\n   - The second \"Rebound\" node is connected from \"Missed Shot\" (count 12) and has a count of 17.\n\n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - The count for the first \"Rebound\" node is 26.\n   - The count for the second \"Rebound\" node is 17.\n   - Total rebounds = 26 + 17 = 43.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe rebound counts are explicitly shown next to the \"Rebound\" nodes. By summing these counts, we can determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>43</answer>",
