  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify all pathways in the diagram where the UNC offense results in a \"Made Shot\" and count the number of sequences for those specific paths.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify UNC Offense Nodes:**\n   - Look for nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" in the diagram. These are the starting points for UNC's offensive plays.\n\n2. **Trace Paths from UNC Offense to Made Shot:**\n   - From each \"UNC Offense\" node, trace the pathway(s) leading to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n   - Ensure that the \"Made Shot\" is directly connected to an \"UNC Offense\" node or through a valid sequence (e.g., no intervening UMD Offense).\n\n3. **Count Sequences for Each Path:**\n   - The numeric labels next to the links indicate the number of sequences following that path.\n   - Sum the counts for all valid paths leading from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot.\"\n\n### Detailed Path Analysis:\n\n#### Path 1:\n- Start at the top-left \"UNC Offense\" node (count = 7).\n- Follow the link to \"Missed Shot\" (count = 7).\n- This path does not lead to a \"Made Shot,\" so it is not counted.\n\n#### Path 2:\n- Move to the second \"UNC Offense\" node (count = 14).\n- Follow the link to \"Rebound\" (count = 14).\n- From \"Rebound,\" follow the link to \"Made Shot\" (count = 7).\n- This path leads to a \"Made Shot\" with a count of 7.\n\n#### Path 3:\n- Move to the third \"UNC Offense\" node (count = 4).\n- Follow the link to \"Rebound\" (count = 1).\n- This path does not lead to a \"Made Shot,\" so it is not counted.\n\n#### Path 4:\n- Move to the fourth \"UNC Offense\" node (count = 4).\n- Follow the link to \"Jump Ball\" (count = 1).\n- This path does not lead to a \"Made Shot,\" so it is not counted.\n\n#### Path 5:\n- Move to the fifth \"UNC Offense\" node (count = 15).\n- Follow the link to \"Foul\" (count = 15).\n- From \"Foul,\" follow the link to \"Made Free Throw\" (count = 13).\n- This path leads to a \"Made Shot\" (via \"Made Free Throw\") with a count of 13.\n\n#### Path 6:\n- Move to the sixth \"UNC Offense\" node (count = 25).\n- Follow the link to \"Made Shot\" (count = 25).\n- This path leads directly to a \"Made Shot\" with a count of 25.\n\n### Summarize Valid Paths:\n- Path 2: \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Rebound\" \u2192 \"Made Shot\" (count = 7)\n- Path 5: \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Foul\" \u2192 \"Made Free Throw\" (count = 13)\n- Path 6: \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Made Shot\" (count = 25)\n\n### Total Count:\nAdd the counts of all valid paths:\n\\[ 7 + 13 + 25 = 45 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>45</answer>",
