  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at various outcomes.\n- The nodes represent events, and the directed links show the flow of sequences between these events.\n- The numeric labels on the links indicate the number of sequences following each path.\n- The question asks about the number of patients who died after arriving at the `Emergency` department.\n\n### Step 2: Trace the pathway leading to death\n1. **Starting Point**: The sequence begins at `_Start`, which has 100 sequences.\n2. **Arrival at Emergency**: All 100 sequences proceed to `Arrival`, and then to `Emergency`.\n3. **From Emergency**: At the `Emergency` node, there are two outgoing paths:\n   - **Path 1**: To `ICU` with 62 sequences.\n   - **Path 2**: Directly to `Discharge-Alive` with 38 sequences.\n4. **From ICU**: At the `ICU` node, there are two outgoing paths:\n   - **Path 1**: To `Floor` with 24 sequences.\n   - **Path 2**: To `Die` with 36 sequences.\n5. **From Floor**: All 24 sequences lead to `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the death pathway\n- The only path leading to death is from `ICU` to `Die`.\n- The link from `ICU` to `Die` is labeled with 36, indicating that 36 sequences end in death.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the sequence leading to death\n- All patients who die must have passed through the `Emergency` department before reaching `ICU`.\n- Therefore, the 36 patients who died after arriving at `Emergency` are those who followed the path:  \n  `_Start` \u2192 `Arrival` \u2192 `Emergency` \u2192 `ICU` \u2192 `Die`.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>36</answer>",
