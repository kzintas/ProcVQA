  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify Relevant Elements\nThe question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. To answer this, we need to:\n- Locate the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram.\n- Identify the link leading to this node and check its numeric label, which represents the number of sequences (patients) following that path.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Diagram\n1. **Start Node**: The diagram begins with the \"_Start\" node, which has a count of 100. This indicates that there are 100 initial sequences or patients entering the system.\n2. **Pathway to Discharge-Alive**:\n   - From the \"Emergency\" node, there is a directed link leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n   - The numeric label on this link is **38**. This means 38 sequences (patients) follow this path and reach the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n3. **Other Paths**:\n   - From the \"Emergency\" node, another link leads to the \"ICU\" node with a count of 62.\n   - From the \"ICU\" node, there are two further paths:\n     - One leads to the \"Die\" node with a count of 36.\n     - Another leads to the \"_Exit\" node with a count of 26.\n   - These other paths do not contribute to the \"Discharge-Alive\" count.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Patients Discharged Alive\nThe only pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of 38. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is directly given by the label on the link leading to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
