  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and pathways:\n- The starting point is `_Start`, which leads to `Arrival`.\n- From `Arrival`, all patients proceed to `Emergency`.\n- From `Emergency`, there are two main pathways:\n  - Pathway 1: Directly to `Discharge-Alive` (38 patients).\n  - Pathway 2: To `Floor` (41 patients).\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway from `Emergency` to `Die`:\n- From `Floor` (41 patients), there are two sub-pathways:\n  - Sub-pathway 1: To `ICU` (24 patients).\n  - Sub-pathway 2: Directly to `Discharge-Alive` (17 patients, calculated as 41 - 24).\n- From `ICU` (24 patients), there are two further sub-pathways:\n  - Sub-pathway 1: To `Floor` (24 patients).\n  - Sub-pathway 2: To `Die` (21 patients).\n\n### 3. Calculate the number of patients who died:\n- The only pathway leading to `Die` is through `ICU`. \n- The number of patients who reached `Die` is explicitly labeled as **21**.\n\n### 4. Verify the total patient flow:\n- Total patients starting at `_Start`: 100.\n- All 100 patients reach `Emergency`.\n- From `Emergency`, 38 patients go directly to `Discharge-Alive`.\n- The remaining 62 patients (100 - 38) proceed to `Floor`.\n- From `Floor`, 24 patients go to `ICU`, and 17 go directly to `Discharge-Alive`.\n- From `ICU`, 24 patients return to `Floor`, and 21 die.\n- The total number of patients accounted for is:\n  - Discharged alive: 38 (directly) + 17 (from Floor) + 24 (from ICU back to Floor) = 79.\n  - Died: 21.\n  - Total: 79 + 21 = 100, which matches the initial count.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>21</answer>",
