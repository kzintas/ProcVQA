  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathway:\nWe need to find the number of patients who went from the **ICU** to the **Floor**. This involves tracing the link between these two nodes.\n\n### 2. Locate the ICU node:\n- The **ICU** node appears in multiple pathways in the diagram.\n- We need to focus on the links originating from the **ICU** node and leading to the **Floor** node.\n\n### 3. Trace the link from ICU to Floor:\n- In the third column (from the left), there is a link from the **ICU** node to the **Floor** node.\n- The numeric label on this link is **23**.\n\n### 4. Verify other potential paths:\n- In the fourth column (from the left), there is another **ICU** node, but it leads directly to the **Die _Exit** node, not the **Floor** node.\n- No other ICU-to-Floor links are present in the diagram.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe only relevant link from **ICU** to **Floor** has a count of **23**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>23</answer>",
