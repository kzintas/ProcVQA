  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\n- The node labeled **\"UMD Offense\"** is the starting point for this analysis.\n- From **\"UMD Offense,\"** there are two outgoing links:\n  1. A link to **\"Rebound\"** with a count of **34**.\n  2. A link to **\"Missed Shot\"** with a count of **14**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the question\nThe question asks for the number of shots missed immediately after the **\"UMD Offense.\"** This corresponds to the link from **\"UMD Offense\"** to **\"Missed Shot.\"**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the link to \"Missed Shot\"\n- The link from **\"UMD Offense\"** to **\"Missed Shot\"** has a numeric label of **14**.\n- This label indicates that **14 sequences** involve a missed shot immediately following the UMD Offense.\n\n### Step 4: Verify other paths\n- The other link from **\"UMD Offense\"** goes to **\"Rebound,\"** which does not represent missed shots but rather successful rebounds.\n- Therefore, this path is irrelevant to the question.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense is explicitly shown as **14**.\n\n<answer>14</answer>",
