Identify the relevant pathway:\n- The question asks about patients who were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n- We need to look for a pathway that starts at \"Arrival,\" goes to \"Emergency,\" and then directly to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n### 2. Examine the diagram for the specified pathway:\n- **Pathway 1**: From \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n  - The link from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\" has a count of 37.\n  - The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a count of 37.\n  - This indicates that all 37 patients who arrived and went to Emergency were discharged alive.\n\n### 3. Verify if there are any other pathways:\n- There are no other direct pathways from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram. The only relevant pathway is the one described above.\n\n### 4. Conclusion:\n- The number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency is the count of the link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive,\" which is 37.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>37</answer>",
