  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total shots were made by UMD offense?\" based on the provided node-link diagram, let's analyze the visualization step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- The event \"UMD Offense\" is a key node in the pathway.\n- Links are labeled with numbers indicating the count of sequences following that path.\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to `_Exit` has a label of **35**.\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of **34**.\n\n### 2. Understand the Context\n- The term \"shots made\" typically refers to successful attempts or outcomes.\n- In this diagram, the direct path from \"UMD Offense\" to `_Exit` likely represents successful outcomes (shots made) because it does not involve a rebound, which usually indicates a missed shot.\n- The path from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" likely represents missed shots, as rebounds occur after a missed attempt.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Pathways\n- **Path 1**: \"UMD Offense\" \u2192 `_Exit` (35 sequences)\n  - This path directly leads to `_Exit`, suggesting successful outcomes (shots made).\n- **Path 2**: \"UMD Offense\" \u2192 \"Rebound\" \u2192 `_Exit` (34 sequences)\n  - This path involves a rebound, indicating missed shots. These do not count as \"shots made.\"\n\n### 4. Calculate Total Shots Made\n- The only pathway that represents successful shots is the direct path from \"UMD Offense\" to `_Exit`.\n- The number of sequences on this path is **35**.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nThe total number of shots made by UMD offense is the count of sequences on the direct path from \"UMD Offense\" to `_Exit`.\n\n<answer>35</answer>",
