  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to identify all the \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram and sum their associated counts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rebound Nodes:**\n   - Look for nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n   - There are three \"Rebound\" nodes visible:\n     1. One under the first \"Missed Shot\" node (count = 7).\n     2. One under the second \"Missed Shot\" node (count = 14).\n     3. One under the third \"Missed Shot\" node (count = 18).\n\n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - Add the counts associated with each \"Rebound\" node:\n     - First Rebound: 7\n     - Second Rebound: 14\n     - Third Rebound: 18\n\n   Total rebounds = 7 + 14 + 18 = 39\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe rebounds are directly indicated by the \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram, and their counts are explicitly shown next to them. By summing these counts, we can determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>39</answer>",
