  "question": "How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the total number of \"Fouls\" made by the \"UMD Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UMD Offense\" is a node that branches out into different pathways.\n- One of these pathways leads to the node labeled \"Foul.\"\n\n### 2. Examine the pathway leading to \"Foul\":\n- From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there is a directed link to the \"Foul\" node.\n- The numeric label on this link is **8**.\n\n### 3. Interpret the link label:\n- The numeric label next to a link represents the number of sequences following that path.\n- Therefore, the label **8** on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Foul\" indicates that there are 8 sequences where a foul was made by UMD Offense.\n\n### 4. Check for additional paths or ambiguities:\n- There are no other links leading to a \"Foul\" node from \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The diagram is clear and does not suggest any hidden or alternative paths involving fouls.\n\n### 5. Final calculation:\n- The total number of fouls made by UMD Offense is directly given by the label on the link to the \"Foul\" node, which is **8**.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The \"UMD Offense\" node has a direct link to the \"Foul\" node.\n- The label on this link is **8**, indicating 8 sequences where a foul occurred.\n- No other paths involve fouls, so this is the complete count.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>8</answer>",
