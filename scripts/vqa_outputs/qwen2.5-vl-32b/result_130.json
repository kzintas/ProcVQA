  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant nodes and links:**\n   - The node labeled \"UNC Offense\" is connected to the node labeled \"UMD Offense.\"\n   - There is a directed link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n2. **Examine the link label:**\n   - The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a numeric label of \"69.\"\n\n3. **Interpret the link label:**\n   - According to the visualization's legend, the numeric labels on the links represent the number of sequences following that path.\n   - Therefore, the label \"69\" indicates that there are 69 sequences where the transition occurs from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense is explicitly given by the label on the link connecting these two nodes.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>69</answer>",
