  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The **UMD Offense** node is a key point in the diagram.\n- From the **UMD Offense** node, there are two outgoing links:\n  - One link leads to the **Rebound** node.\n  - Another link leads directly to the **_Exit** node.\n\n### 2. Interpret the Links\n- The link from **UMD Offense** to **Rebound** has a label of **34**, indicating that 34 sequences follow this path.\n- The link from **UMD Offense** to **_Exit** has a label of **35**, indicating that 35 sequences follow this path.\n\n### 3. Understand the Context\n- In basketball, a rebound typically occurs after a missed shot. Therefore, the **Rebound** node represents missed shots that result in a rebound.\n- The **_Exit** node likely represents scenarios where the sequence ends without a rebound, such as a successful shot or a turnover.\n\n### 4. Calculate Missed Shots\n- Since the **Rebound** node represents missed shots, the number of sequences leading to **Rebound** (34) corresponds to the number of missed shots immediately after **UMD Offense**.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\nThe number of shots missed immediately after **UMD Offense** is explicitly shown as 34.\n\n<answer>34</answer>",
