  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "19",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify all pathways in the diagram where \"Missed Shot\" occurs after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\" Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant sections of the diagram\n- We are looking for sequences that start with \"UNC Offense.\"\n- We need to count \"Missed Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the pathways\n#### Pathway 1: Top-left branch\n1. **Start** \u2192 **UNC Offense** (2 sequences)\n2. **Jump Ball** (1 sequence)\n3. **Missed Shot** (2 sequences)\n4. **Rebound** \u2192 **Made Shot** \u2192 **Exit**\n\n   - Here, there is 1 \"Missed Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n#### Pathway 2: Middle branch\n1. **Start** \u2192 **UNC Offense** (19 sequences)\n2. **Missed Shot** (19 sequences)\n3. **Rebound** \u2192 **UMD Offense** \u2192 **Made Shot** \u2192 **Exit**\n\n   - Here, there is 1 \"Missed Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n#### Pathway 3: Right-middle branch\n1. **Start** \u2192 **UNC Offense** (33 sequences)\n2. **Made Shot** (28 sequences)\n3. **UMD Offense** \u2192 **Missed Shot** (18 sequences) \u2192 **Rebound** \u2192 **Made Shot** \u2192 **Exit**\n\n   - Here, there is 1 \"Missed Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n#### Pathway 4: Rightmost branch\n1. **Start** \u2192 **UNC Offense** (15 sequences)\n2. **Foul** (15 sequences)\n3. **UMD Offense** \u2192 **Missed Shot** (11 sequences) \u2192 **Rebound** \u2192 **Made Shot** \u2192 **Exit**\n\n   - Here, there is 1 \"Missed Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 3: Sum the counts\n- From the top-left branch: 2 sequences\n- From the middle branch: 19 sequences\n- From the right-middle branch: 33 sequences\n- From the rightmost branch: 15 sequences\n\nEach of these branches contributes one \"Missed Shot\" event after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\" Therefore, we sum the number of sequences in each branch:\n\n\\[\n2 + 19 + 33 + 15 = 69\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>69</answer>",
