  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": "6",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant pathway:\nThe question asks about the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense. We need to focus on the pathway starting from the \"UMD Offense\" node and follow it to the \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- **Start Node**: UMD Offense (69 sequences)\n- **First Split**: From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two main paths:\n  - Path 1: To \"Rebound\" (34 sequences)\n  - Path 2: To \"Missed Shot\" (14 sequences)\n- **Focus on \"Missed Shot\"**: Since free throws are typically associated with fouls after a missed shot, we follow the \"Missed Shot\" path.\n- **From \"Missed Shot\"**: There are two further paths:\n  - Path 1: To \"Turnover\" (4 sequences)\n  - Path 2: To \"Foul\" (10 sequences)\n- **From \"Foul\"**: There are two paths:\n  - Path 1: To \"Made Free Throw\" (6 sequences)\n  - Path 2: To \"_Exit\" (4 sequences)\n\n### 3. Identify the \"Made Free Throw\" node:\nThe \"Made Free Throw\" node is directly connected to the \"Foul\" node, and the link shows a count of 6 sequences.\n\n### 4. Calculate the total number of free throws made:\nThe number of sequences leading to the \"Made Free Throw\" node is explicitly labeled as 6. This represents the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>6</answer>",
