  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" occurred after \"UNC Offense.\"\n- In the diagram, \"UNC Offense\" is represented as a node with a label and a count next to it.\n- We need to look for directed links from \"UNC Offense\" nodes to \"Jump Ball\" nodes.\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways:\n- There are multiple instances of \"UNC Offense\" in the diagram. We need to check each one to see if it leads to a \"Jump Ball.\"\n- Starting from the top-left section of the diagram:\n  - The first \"UNC Offense\" node has a count of **2**. From this node, there is a link to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of **1**.\n  - Moving to the next \"UNC Offense\" node (count = **13**), there is no direct link to \"Jump Ball.\"\n  - The next \"UNC Offense\" node (count = **26**) does not have a link to \"Jump Ball.\"\n  - The next \"UNC Offense\" node (count = **21**) does not have a link to \"Jump Ball.\"\n  - The final \"UNC Offense\" node (count = **7**) does not have a link to \"Jump Ball.\"\n\n### 3. Summarize the findings:\n- Only one instance of \"UNC Offense\" (with a count of **2**) leads directly to a \"Jump Ball.\"\n- The count of sequences following this path is **1**.\n\n### 4. Final Answer:\nThe number of times a \"Jump Ball\" occurred after \"UNC Offense\" is explicitly shown as **1**.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
