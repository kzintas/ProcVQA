  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "10",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and leading to various outcomes.\n- The node `UMD Offense` is the primary focus, as it represents the UMD team's offensive plays.\n- From `UMD Offense`, there are several pathways leading to different outcomes:\n  - `Rebound` (34 sequences)\n  - `Missed Shot` (14 sequences)\n  - `Foul` (8 sequences)\n  - `Made Shot` (3 sequences)\n  - `_Exit` (implying the end of a sequence without a specific outcome)\n\n### 2. Understand the context of free throws:\n- Free throws are typically associated with fouls in basketball. Therefore, we need to focus on the `Foul` node.\n- From the `Foul` node, there is a link to `_Exit` with a count of 10 sequences. This suggests that after a foul, the sequence ends, which could imply free throws were made (since fouls often lead to free throws).\n\n### 3. Analyze the `Foul` node:\n- The `Foul` node has a total of 8 sequences leading into it from `UMD Offense`.\n- All 8 sequences from `Foul` lead to `_Exit`, with a count of 10 sequences. This discrepancy (8 vs. 10) suggests that the 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws made after fouls.\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- The `Foul` node indicates that 8 sequences involve fouls.\n- The 10 sequences leading from `Foul` to `_Exit` suggest that these 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws made after fouls.\n- Since the question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we can conclude that the 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>10</answer>",
