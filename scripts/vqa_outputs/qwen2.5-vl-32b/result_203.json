  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- We need to focus on the pathway starting from the node labeled \"_Start\" and following the sequence where \"UNC Offense\" occurs.\n- After \"UNC Offense,\" we need to check if there is a link leading to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\n- The link widths and numeric labels will help us determine the frequency of each event.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- The diagram shows multiple pathways starting from \"_Start.\"\n- One of these pathways leads to \"UNC Offense\" with a count of 7 sequences.\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" we need to check the outgoing links:\n  - There is a link to \"Rebound\" with a count of 7.\n  - There is a link to \"Turnover\" with a count of 0.\n  - There is a link to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1.\n\n### 3. Analyze the \"Jump Ball\" link:\n- The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" has a count of 1.\n- This indicates that in the sequences where \"UNC Offense\" occurred, a jump ball happened 1 time.\n\n### 4. Verify other pathways:\n- There are other pathways involving \"UNC Offense\" with different counts (e.g., 14, 4, 15, 25), but we need to focus on the specific link to \"Jump Ball.\"\n- In all other pathways, the link to \"Jump Ball\" is not present or has a count of 0.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\n- The only instance where a jump ball occurred after \"UNC Offense\" is in the pathway with a count of 1.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>1</answer>",
