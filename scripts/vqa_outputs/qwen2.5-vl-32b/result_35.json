  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The starting point is `_Start`, which leads to `Arrival` with a count of 100.\n- From `Arrival`, all patients proceed to `Emergency`.\n- From `Emergency`, there are two pathways:\n  - One leads directly to `Discharge-Alive` (`_Exit`) with a count of 38.\n  - The other leads to `Floor` with a count of 21.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway leading to death:\n- From `Floor`, there are two further pathways:\n  - One leads to `ICU` with a count of 41.\n  - The other leads directly to `Die` with a count of 36.\n- The patients who die are those who follow the path from `Floor` to `Die`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the number of patients who died:\n- The number of patients who die is explicitly labeled on the link from `Floor` to `Die`: **36**.\n\n### 4. Verify the flow:\n- All 100 patients start at `_Start`.\n- All 100 patients arrive at `Emergency`.\n- From `Emergency`, 38 patients are discharged alive, leaving 62 patients to proceed to `Floor` (100 - 38 = 62).\n- From `Floor`, 36 patients die, and the remaining 26 proceed to `ICU` (62 - 36 = 26).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is **36**.\n\n<answer>36</answer>",
