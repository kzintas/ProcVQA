  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- The node labeled \"UMD Offense\" is a key point in the sequence.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two outgoing links:\n  - One leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n  - The other leads directly to `_Exit` with a count of 22.\n\n### 2. Understand the question:\nThe question asks how many steals occurred after \"UMD Offense.\" In the context of basketball, a steal typically occurs when the defending team intercepts the ball from the opposing team. However, the diagram does not explicitly label any event as a \"steal.\" Instead, it shows pathways leading to \"Rebound\" and `_Exit`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the pathways:\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of 34. This likely represents sequences where UMD gained possession of the ball after a rebound.\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to `_Exit` has a count of 22. This could represent sequences where UMD's offense ended without a rebound, possibly due to a turnover, a missed shot, or another event that led directly to the end of the sequence.\n\n### 4. Determine if there are any steals:\n- The diagram does not explicitly label any event as a \"steal.\" \n- The only direct outcome from \"UMD Offense\" is either a \"Rebound\" or `_Exit`. There is no node or link labeled as a \"steal.\"\n- Since the diagram does not provide any information about steals, we cannot determine the number of steals that occurred after \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe visualization does not contain any information about steals. Therefore, the number of steals cannot be determined from the given diagram.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
