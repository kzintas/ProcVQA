  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The starting point is labeled `_Start`, with 100 patients entering the system.\n- Patients proceed to `Arrival` and then to `Emergency`.\n- From `Emergency`, there are two main pathways:\n  - One leads directly to `Discharge-Alive` (38 patients).\n  - The other leads to `ICU` (62 patients).\n- From `ICU`, there are two pathways:\n  - One leads to `Floor` (24 patients).\n  - The other leads to `Die` (36 patients).\n- From `Floor`, there are two pathways:\n  - One leads to `Discharge-Alive` (24 patients).\n  - The other leads to `_Exit` (24 patients).\n\n### 2. Focus on the pathway leading to `Discharge-Alive` after going to `Floor`:\n- The number of patients who went to `Floor` is 24.\n- All 24 patients who went to `Floor` eventually reached `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the `Floor`:\n- The diagram explicitly shows that 24 patients went from `Floor` to `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the `Floor`.\n- From the diagram, we can see that all 24 patients who went to `Floor` were discharged alive.\n- No other pathway from `Floor` leads to `Discharge-Alive`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>24</answer>",
