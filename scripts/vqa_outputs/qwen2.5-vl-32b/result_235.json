  "full_response": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to identify all instances of \"Missed Shot\" in the diagram and sum their respective counts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify \"Missed Shot\" Nodes:**\n   - Look for nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the diagram.\n   - There are three occurrences of \"Missed Shot\":\n     1. In the first pathway (leftmost column).\n     2. In the second pathway (second column from the left).\n     3. In the fourth pathway (fourth column from the left).\n\n2. **Extract Counts for Each \"Missed Shot\":**\n   - For the first pathway:\n     - The \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of **19**.\n   - For the second pathway:\n     - The \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of **19**.\n   - For the fourth pathway:\n     - The \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of **19**.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - Add the counts of all \"Missed Shot\" nodes:\n     \\[\n     19 + 19 + 19 = 57\n     \\]\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The diagram shows multiple pathways, each representing different sequences of events.\n- \"Missed Shot\" is a specific event that occurs in certain pathways.\n- By identifying all instances of \"Missed Shot\" and summing their respective counts, we can determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>57</answer>",
