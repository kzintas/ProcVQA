  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",

  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The **UNC Offense** node has two outgoing links:\n  - One leading to **Made Shot** with a count of 22.\n  - One leading to **Missed Shot** with a count of 24.\n- The **Missed Shot** node has an outgoing link to **UMD Offense** with a count of 24.\n\n### 2. Understand the Transition\nThe question asks how many times **UMD Offense** transitioned from **UNC Offense**. This means we need to trace the pathway from **UNC Offense** to **UMD Offense**.\n\n- From **UNC Offense**, there is a direct path to **Missed Shot** (count = 24).\n- From **Missed Shot**, there is a direct path to **UMD Offense** (count = 24).\n\nSince the link from **Missed Shot** to **UMD Offense** has a count of 24, this indicates that 24 sequences transitioned from **UNC Offense** to **UMD Offense** via the **Missed Shot** event.\n\n### 3. Verify and Conclude\nThere are no other pathways from **UNC Offense** to **UMD Offense** in the diagram. The only valid transition is through the **Missed Shot** event, which has a count of 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>24</answer>",
