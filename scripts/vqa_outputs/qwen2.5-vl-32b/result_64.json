  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at various `_Exit` nodes.\n- The number next to each link represents the count of sequences following that path.\n- We are interested in the number of patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- **Starting Point**: `_Start` \u2192 `Arrival` \u2192 `Emergency`\n  - All 100 patients start at `_Start` and proceed to `Arrival`.\n  - From `Arrival`, all 100 patients proceed to `Emergency`.\n\n- **Branching at `Emergency`**:\n  - From `Emergency`, there are two paths:\n    1. **Path 1**: `Emergency` \u2192 `ICU` (62 patients)\n    2. **Path 2**: `Emergency` \u2192 `Discharge-Alive` (38 patients)\n\n- **Focus on `Discharge-Alive`**:\n  - The question asks about patients discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n  - The path leading directly to `Discharge-Alive` (38 patients) indicates these patients were discharged alive without going to the ICU.\n  - There is no explicit mention of a \"Floor\" in the diagram, but since the question specifies \"after going to the Floor,\" we must assume the Floor is represented by the `Discharge-Alive` path, as it is the only direct discharge route.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total:\n- The number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is explicitly shown as 38.\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- The diagram does not explicitly label a \"Floor\" node, but the question implies that the `Discharge-Alive` path represents patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n- Since the `Discharge-Alive` path directly leads to `_Exit` with 38 patients, this is the number we are looking for.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
