  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total shots were made by UMD offense?\" based on the provided node-link diagram, let's analyze the visualization step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- The node labeled \"UMD Offense\" is a critical point in the pathway.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two outgoing paths:\n  - One leads to \"Rebound\" with a link labeled `34`.\n  - The other leads directly to `_Exit` with a link labeled `35`.\n\n### 2. Interpret the Link Labels\n- The numeric labels on the links represent the number of sequences following that path.\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of `34`, indicating that 34 sequences involve a rebound after UMD's offense.\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to `_Exit` has a label of `35`, indicating that 35 sequences end directly after UMD's offense without a rebound.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Shots by UMD Offense\n- Every sequence that passes through \"UMD Offense\" represents an offensive play by UMD.\n- The total number of sequences passing through \"UMD Offense\" is the sum of the sequences going to \"Rebound\" and those going directly to `_Exit`.\n- Therefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is:\n  \\[\n  34 + 35 = 69\n  \\]\n\n### 4. Verify Consistency\n- The link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\" is labeled `69`, which matches the total number of sequences reaching \"UMD Offense.\" This confirms the consistency of the data.\n\n### Reasoning Summary\n- The node \"UMD Offense\" is the focal point for determining the total shots made by UMD.\n- The outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" show two possible outcomes: a rebound (`34` sequences) or a direct exit (`35` sequences).\n- Summing these outcomes gives the total number of sequences involving UMD's offense, which is `69`.\n\n### Final Answer\n<answer>69</answer>",
