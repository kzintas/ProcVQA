  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The **UMD Offense** node is a starting point for sequences.\n- From **UMD Offense**, there are multiple pathways leading to different events.\n- We need to focus on the pathway that leads to the **Foul** event.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway to the Foul event:\n- From **UMD Offense**, there is a link labeled with the number **10** leading to **Missed Shot**.\n- From **Missed Shot**, there is a link labeled with the number **8** leading to **Foul**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of Fouls:\n- The link from **UMD Offense** to **Missed Shot** has a count of **10**.\n- The link from **Missed Shot** to **Foul** has a count of **8**.\n- Since the link from **UMD Offense** to **Foul** is sequential, the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense is the product of these counts:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 8 = 80\n  \\]\n\n### 4. Verify the calculation:\n- The link widths and numeric labels confirm the sequence and counts.\n- There are no other pathways from **UMD Offense** directly or indirectly leading to **Foul** without going through **Missed Shot**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>80</answer>",
