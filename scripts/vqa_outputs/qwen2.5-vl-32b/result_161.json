  "question": "How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "27",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant section of the diagram:\nThe question asks about rebounds made after \"UMD Offense.\" We need to focus on the pathways that originate from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n\n### 2. Locate the \"UMD Offense\" node:\n- The \"UMD Offense\" node is clearly labeled in the diagram.\n- From this node, there are several outgoing links representing different possible events.\n\n### 3. Identify the link leading to \"Rebound\":\n- From the \"UMD Offense\" node, one of the outgoing links leads to the \"Rebound\" node.\n- The numeric label on this link indicates the number of sequences that follow this path.\n\n### 4. Examine the link to \"Rebound\":\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with the number **27**.\n- This means there are 27 sequences where a rebound occurred after UMD Offense.\n\n### 5. Verify if there are any other paths leading to rebounds:\n- After examining the diagram, there are no other direct or indirect paths from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" besides the one we identified.\n- All other outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" lead to different events (e.g., \"Made Shot,\" \"Missed Shot,\" \"Foul,\" etc.).\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The question asks for the number of rebounds after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The diagram shows a direct link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a count of 27.\n- No other paths lead to rebounds from \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>27</answer>",
