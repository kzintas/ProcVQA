  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total shots were made by UMD offense?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The **\"UMD Offense\"** node is the starting point for UMD's offensive sequences.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two outgoing paths:\n  - One leads to the **\"Rebound\"** node.\n  - The other leads directly to the **\"Missed Shot\"** node.\n- The **\"Rebound\"** node has a further path leading to the **\"Made Shot\"** node.\n- The **\"Made Shot\"** node leads to the **\"_Exit\"** node, indicating a completed sequence where a shot was made.\n\n### 2. Analyze the link counts:\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of **34**.\n- The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a count of **15**.\n- The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of **14**.\n\n### 3. Determine the total shots made:\n- A shot is considered \"made\" only if it leads to the \"Made Shot\" node.\n- The only path that leads to a \"Made Shot\" is through the sequence:\n  - \"UMD Offense\" \u2192 \"Rebound\" \u2192 \"Made Shot\".\n- The count of sequences that follow this path is the count of the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot,\" which is **15**.\n\n### 4. Verify other paths:\n- The path \"UMD Offense\" \u2192 \"Missed Shot\" leads to a \"Missed Shot,\" not a \"Made Shot.\"\n- Therefore, this path does not contribute to the total shots made.\n\n### 5. Final calculation:\n- The total number of shots made by UMD offense is the count of sequences that reach the \"Made Shot\" node, which is **15**.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The \"Made Shot\" node is the only endpoint that represents a successful shot.\n- The count of sequences leading to \"Made Shot\" is **15**.\n- No other paths contribute to the total shots made.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>15</answer>",
