  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- Events are represented as nodes, and directed links show the flow between events.\n- The link widths and numeric labels indicate the number of sequences following each path.\n- We need to focus on the section of the diagram after \"UMD Offense\" to determine if there are any steals.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Pathways After \"UMD Offense\":\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two outgoing paths:\n  1. A link to \"Rebound\" with a count of **34**.\n  2. A link directly to `_Exit` with a count of **35**.\n\n### 3. Look for Steals:\n- A \"steal\" is not explicitly labeled in the diagram. In basketball terminology, a steal typically occurs when one team intercepts the ball from the opposing team during their offensive possession.\n- In this diagram, there is no node or link labeled \"Steal\" after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The only possible outcomes shown after \"UMD Offense\" are either a \"Rebound\" or directly exiting the sequence (`_Exit`).\n\n### 4. Conclusion:\n- Since there is no node or link labeled \"Steal\" in the diagram, we cannot determine the number of steals that occurred after \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
