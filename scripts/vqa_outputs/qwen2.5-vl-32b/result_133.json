  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The node labeled **Rebound** is of interest because we need to determine how many shots were made directly after a Rebound.\n- From the Rebound node, there are two outgoing links:\n  - One link leads to the node **Made Shot**.\n  - Another link leads to the node **_Exit**.\n\n### 2. Examine the link leading to **Made Shot**:\n- The link from **Rebound** to **Made Shot** has a numeric label of **15**.\n- This number represents the count of sequences where a Made Shot occurred directly after a Rebound.\n\n### 3. Consider the other link:\n- The link from **Rebound** to **_Exit** has a numeric label of **19**.\n- However, this link does not represent shots made; it indicates sequences where the play ended after a Rebound without a subsequent shot being made.\n\n### 4. Focus on the question:\nThe question asks specifically about the number of shots made directly after a Rebound. Based on the diagram:\n- Only the link from **Rebound** to **Made Shot** is relevant.\n- The count associated with this link is **15**.\n\n### 5. Final Answer:\nThe number of shots made directly after a Rebound is explicitly shown as **15**.\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
