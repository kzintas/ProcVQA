  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- The event \"Emergency\" is a critical node where patients either proceed to \"ICU\" or \"Discharge-Alive\".\n- From \"ICU,\" there is a further split where patients either \"Die\" or are discharged alive.\n- The link widths and numeric labels indicate the number of sequences following each path.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- **Starting Point**: All 100 patients arrive at \"Arrival\".\n- **From Arrival to Emergency**: All 100 patients proceed to \"Emergency\".\n- **From Emergency**:\n  - 62 patients go to \"ICU\".\n  - 38 patients are discharged alive (\"Discharge-Alive\").\n- **From ICU**:\n  - 36 patients die.\n  - 36 patients are discharged alive.\n\n### 3. Calculate the number of patients who died:\n- The only pathway leading to death is through \"ICU\".\n- The link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" shows that 36 patients die.\n\n### 4. Reasoning:\n- The question asks specifically about patients who died after arriving at \"Emergency\".\n- All patients who die must pass through \"ICU\" after \"Emergency\".\n- The number of patients who die is explicitly shown as 36 on the link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>36</answer>",
