  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- Events are connected by directed links, and the width of the links indicates the number of sequences following that path.\n- The question asks for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 2: Trace the pathways through the diagram\n1. **Starting Point**: The diagram begins at `_Start`, which has 69 sequences.\n2. **First Split**: From `_Start`, there is a link to \"UNC Offense\" with 69 sequences.\n3. **After UNC Offense**:\n   - From \"UNC Offense,\" there are two possible paths:\n     - A link to \"Rebound\" with 15 sequences.\n     - A link to \"Missed Shot\" with 15 sequences.\n   - From \"Missed Shot,\" there is a link to \"Made Shot\" with 22 sequences.\n4. **Before UMD Offense**:\n   - The \"Made Shot\" node (with 22 sequences) leads directly to \"UMD Offense.\"\n   - This means the \"Made Shot\" event occurs after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the specific question\n- The question asks for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occur after \"UNC Offense\" but before \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From the diagram, we see that the \"Made Shot\" node has 22 sequences, and it is positioned between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Step 4: Verify the counts\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with 22 sequences.\n- This confirms that 22 sequences involve a \"Made Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>22</answer>",
