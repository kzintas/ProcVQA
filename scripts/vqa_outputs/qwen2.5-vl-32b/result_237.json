  "question": "How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to analyze the node-link diagram and identify the pathways that involve only the UNC offense leading to a \"Made Shot.\" Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and links:\n- The diagram shows sequences starting with `_Start` and ending with `_Exit`.\n- We are interested in the paths where \"UNC Offense\" leads directly to \"Made Shot.\"\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways involving \"UNC Offense\":\n- There are multiple instances of \"UNC Offense\" in the diagram. We need to trace each one to see if it leads to a \"Made Shot.\"\n- The key is to ensure that the path does not involve any other team's offense (e.g., UMD Offense) before reaching \"Made Shot.\"\n\n### 3. Analyze each pathway:\n#### Pathway 1:\n- Starts at `_Start` (count = 2).\n- Follows the link to \"UNC Offense\" (count = 2).\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" there is a direct link to \"Made Shot\" (count = 2).\n\nThis pathway involves only the UNC offense leading to a \"Made Shot.\" The count for this pathway is **2**.\n\n#### Pathway 2:\n- Starts at `_Start` (count = 19).\n- Follows the link to \"UNC Offense\" (count = 19).\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" the next event is \"Missed Shot\" (count = 19), which does not lead directly to \"Made Shot.\"\n\nThis pathway does not meet the criteria since it does not lead to a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n#### Pathway 3:\n- Starts at `_Start` (count = 12).\n- Follows the link to \"UNC Offense\" (count = 12).\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" the next event is \"Foul\" (count = 12), which does not lead directly to \"Made Shot.\"\n\nThis pathway does not meet the criteria since it does not lead to a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n#### Pathway 4:\n- Starts at `_Start` (count = 8).\n- Follows the link to \"UNC Offense\" (count = 8).\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" the next event is \"Turnover\" (count = 5), which does not lead directly to \"Made Shot.\"\n\nThis pathway does not meet the criteria since it does not lead to a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n#### Pathway 5:\n- Starts at `_Start` (count = 28).\n- Follows the link to \"UNC Offense\" (count = 28).\n- From \"UNC Offense,\" the next event is \"Made Shot\" (count = 20).\n\nThis pathway involves only the UNC offense leading to a \"Made Shot.\" The count for this pathway is **20**.\n\n### 4. Summarize the valid pathways:\n- Pathway 1: `_Start` \u2192 \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Made Shot\" (count = 2).\n- Pathway 5: `_Start` \u2192 \"UNC Offense\" \u2192 \"Made Shot\" (count = 20).\n\n### 5. Calculate the total number of shots made by only the UNC offense:\n- Add the counts from the valid pathways: 2 + 20 = 22.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>22</answer>",
