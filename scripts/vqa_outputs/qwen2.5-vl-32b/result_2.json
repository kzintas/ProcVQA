  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The starting point is labeled `_Start`, with 100 sequences entering the system.\n- The next node is `Arrival`, which also has 100 sequences.\n- From `Arrival`, there is a directed link to `Emergency` with 100 sequences.\n- From `Emergency`, there are two outgoing paths:\n  - One path leads directly to `Discharge-Alive` with 38 sequences.\n  - The other path leads to `ICU` with 62 sequences.\n\n### 2. Understand the question:\nWe need to determine how many patients were discharged alive **directly after arriving at Emergency**. This means we are looking for the number of sequences that go from `Emergency` to `Discharge-Alive` without passing through any intermediate nodes.\n\n### 3. Analyze the pathway:\n- The link from `Emergency` to `Discharge-Alive` is explicitly labeled with 38 sequences.\n- This indicates that 38 patients were discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.\n\n### 4. Verify other pathways:\n- The other path from `Emergency` leads to `ICU`, which then splits into further outcomes (e.g., `Die`, `Floor`, etc.). However, these are not part of the \"direct discharge\" scenario we are focusing on.\n- Therefore, we do not need to consider the `ICU` branch for this specific question.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency is clearly indicated by the link labeled 38.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>38</answer>",
