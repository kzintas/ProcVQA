  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- The nodes represent events, and the directed links show transitions between these events.\n- The link widths and numeric labels indicate the number of sequences following each path.\n- We are interested in the transition from `UNC Offense` to `UMD Offense`.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- Starting from `_Start`, there are 69 sequences.\n- From `_Start`, the sequences transition to `UNC Offense`.\n- From `UNC Offense`, there are two possible paths:\n  1. `Made Shot` (22 sequences)\n  2. `Missed Shot` (15 sequences)\n\n### 3. Focus on the transition to `UMD Offense`:\n- The `Missed Shot` path leads directly to `UMD Offense` (15 sequences).\n- The `Made Shot` path does not lead directly to `UMD Offense`; instead, it leads to `Rebound` (22 sequences), and from there, it transitions to `_Exit` (22 sequences).\n\n### 4. Calculate the number of transitions from `UNC Offense` to `UMD Offense`:\n- The only path from `UNC Offense` to `UMD Offense` is through the `Missed Shot` event.\n- The number of sequences following this path is explicitly labeled as 15.\n\n### 5. Final Answer:\nThe number of times `UMD Offense` transitioned from `UNC Offense` is 15.\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
