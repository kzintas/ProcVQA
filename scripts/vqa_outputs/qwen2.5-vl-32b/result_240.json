  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to identify all the \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram and sum their corresponding sequence counts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rebound Nodes:**\n   - Look for nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n   - There are three \"Rebound\" nodes visible in the diagram.\n\n2. **Extract Sequence Counts for Each Rebound Node:**\n   - The first \"Rebound\" node has a sequence count of **14**.\n   - The second \"Rebound\" node has a sequence count of **5**.\n   - The third \"Rebound\" node has a sequence count of **8**.\n\n3. **Sum the Sequence Counts:**\n   - Total rebounds = 14 + 5 + 8 = 27.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The sequence counts next to each link indicate how many times that particular event occurred in the dataset.\n- By summing the sequence counts of all \"Rebound\" nodes, we get the total number of rebounds made by both teams.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>27</answer>",
