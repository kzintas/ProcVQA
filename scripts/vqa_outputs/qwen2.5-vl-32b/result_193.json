  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many total rebounds are there in the match?\" based on the provided node-link diagram, let's analyze the visualization step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Elements\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- The event labeled \"Rebound\" is directly connected to the \"Missed Shot\" event.\n- The link connecting \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" has a numeric label of `24`, indicating the number of sequences where a rebound occurred after a missed shot.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Diagram\n- The `_Start` node leads to two pathways: \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n  - The \"Made Shot\" pathway does not lead to a rebound, as it directly transitions to `_Exit`.\n  - The \"Missed Shot\" pathway leads to \"Rebound\", which then transitions to `_Exit`.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Rebounds\n- The only path that involves a rebound is the one starting from \"Missed Shot\" and leading to \"Rebound\".\n- The link between \"Missed Shot\" and \"Rebound\" is labeled with the number `24`, which represents the count of sequences where a rebound occurred.\n- Since there are no other paths or nodes labeled as \"Rebound,\" the total number of rebounds is solely determined by this link.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe total number of rebounds in the match is explicitly shown as `24`.\n\n<answer>24</answer>",
