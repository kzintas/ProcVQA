  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The **UMD Offense** node is a key starting point for our analysis.\n- We need to look at all pathways that originate from the **UMD Offense** node and identify any events labeled as \"Steals.\"\n\n### 2. Examine the pathways from UMD Offense:\nFrom the **UMD Offense** node, there are two outgoing links:\n1. A link to the **Rebound** node with a count of **34**.\n2. A link to the **_Exit** node with a count of **22**.\n\n### 3. Look for \"Steals\" in the pathways:\n- The diagram does not explicitly show any node labeled as \"Steal\" or any pathway leading to a \"Steal\" event.\n- All visible pathways from **UMD Offense** lead to either **Rebound** or **_Exit**, and neither of these nodes represents a steal.\n\n### 4. Consider the structure of the diagram:\n- The diagram shows a clear sequence of events, but \"Steals\" are not part of the visible pathways.\n- Since there is no node or link labeled as \"Steal,\" we cannot infer the occurrence of steals based on the provided visualization.\n\n### 5. Conclusion:\nThe diagram does not provide any information about steals occurring after UMD Offense. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of steals from the given visualization.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
