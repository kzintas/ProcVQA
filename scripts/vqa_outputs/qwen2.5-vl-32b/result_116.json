Identify the relevant elements:\n- The starting point is the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two outgoing links:\n  - One leads to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n  - The other leads to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\n\n### 2. Focus on the \"Missed Shot\" link:\n- The question asks for the number of shots missed immediately after \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The link directly connecting \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" has a count of 14.\n\n### 3. Verify if there are any other paths involving missed shots:\n- There are no other direct paths from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Missed Shot.\"\n- The only path leading to \"Missed Shot\" from \"UMD Offense\" is the one with a count of 14.\n\n### 4.
