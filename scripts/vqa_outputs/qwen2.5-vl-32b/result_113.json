  "question": "How many total Rebounds were made by UMD Offense?",

  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The question asks about the total number of rebounds made by UMD Offense.\n- In the diagram, \"Rebound\" is a node that follows the \"Missed Shot\" node under the \"UMD Offense\" branch.\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" has a numeric label indicating the count of sequences.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway:\n- Start at the \"_Start\" node, which leads to \"UNC Offense\" and then to \"UMD Offense.\"\n- From \"UMD Offense,\" there is a link to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14 sequences.\n- From \"Missed Shot,\" there is a link to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 sequences.\n\n### 3. Interpret the counts:\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" is labeled with the number 34. This indicates that out of the 14 sequences that reached \"Missed Shot,\" 34 sequences resulted in a rebound.\n- However, this seems inconsistent because the number of sequences leading to \"Missed Shot\" (14) cannot logically result in more sequences (34) leading to \"Rebound.\" This suggests a potential error or misinterpretation in the visualization.\n\n### 4. Re-evaluate the context:\n- Given the structure of the diagram, it's possible that the link width or label might be misinterpreted. Typically, the number on a link represents the count of sequences following that path.\n- If we assume the label 34 is correct, it would imply an anomaly since it exceeds the incoming sequence count (14). Without additional context, we must rely on the explicit values shown.\n\n### 5. Final reasoning:\n- The diagram explicitly shows a link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" labeled with 34. Even though this number exceeds the incoming sequence count (14), we must accept the value as presented unless otherwise clarified.\n- Therefore, based on the visualization, the total number of rebounds made by UMD Offense is represented by the label on the link to \"Rebound.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>34</answer>",
