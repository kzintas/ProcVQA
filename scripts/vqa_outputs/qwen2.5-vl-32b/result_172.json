  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to analyze the node-link diagram and identify all the paths that lead to the \"Rebound\" node. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify the Rebound Nodes\n- There are two \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram:\n  - One under \"UNC Offense\"\n  - One under \"UMD Offense\"\n\n### 2. Trace the Paths Leading to Each Rebound Node\n#### Rebound under UNC Offense:\n- The path leading to this \"Rebound\" node comes from the \"Missed Shot\" node under \"UNC Offense.\"\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of **15**.\n\n#### Rebound under UMD Offense:\n- The path leading to this \"Rebound\" node comes from the \"Missed Shot\" node under \"UMD Offense.\"\n- The link from \"Missed Shot\" to \"Rebound\" has a count of **7**.\n\n### 3. Sum the Rebounds\n- Rebounds from UNC Offense: **15**\n- Rebounds from UMD Offense: **7**\n- Total rebounds = 15 + 7 = **22**\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>22</answer>",
