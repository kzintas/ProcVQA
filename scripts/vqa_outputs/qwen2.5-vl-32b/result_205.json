  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to identify all the \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram and sum up the counts associated with them. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all \"Rebound\" nodes\nFrom the diagram, we can see the following \"Rebound\" nodes:\n1. **Rebound** (after UNC Offense, count = 7)\n2. **Rebound** (after UMD Offense, count = 14)\n3. **Rebound** (after Jump Ball, count = 1)\n4. **Rebound** (after Turnover, count = 2)\n5. **Rebound** (after Made Shot, count = 7)\n6. **Rebound** (after Missed Shot, count = 6)\n7. **Rebound** (after UMD Offense, count = 13)\n8. **Rebound** (after Made Free Throw, count = 8)\n\n### Step 2: Sum the counts of all \"Rebound\" nodes\nNow, let's add up the counts for each \"Rebound\" node:\n- Rebound (after UNC Offense): 7\n- Rebound (after UMD Offense): 14\n- Rebound (after Jump Ball): 1\n- Rebound (after Turnover): 2\n- Rebound (after Made Shot): 7\n- Rebound (after Missed Shot): 6\n- Rebound (after UMD Offense): 13\n- Rebound (after Made Free Throw): 8\n\nSumming these values:\n\\[ 7 + 14 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 13 + 8 = 58 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the total\nWe have accounted for all \"Rebound\" nodes and their respective counts. The total sum is 58.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>58</answer>",
