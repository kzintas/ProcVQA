  "full_response": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to analyze the node-link diagram and identify all the paths that lead to the \"Rebound\" nodes. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Nodes and Links\n- The diagram shows two \"Rebound\" nodes:\n  - One under \"UNC Offense\"\n  - One under \"UMD Offense\"\n\n### 2. Analyze the Paths Leading to Each Rebound Node\n#### a. Rebound under \"UNC Offense\":\n- This rebound is reached from the \"Missed Shot\" node.\n- The link leading to this rebound has a count of **15**.\n\n#### b. Rebound under \"UMD Offense\":\n- This rebound is reached from the \"Made Shot\" node.\n- The link leading to this rebound has a count of **34**.\n\n### 3. Sum the Rebounds\n- Total rebounds = Rebounds under \"UNC Offense\" + Rebounds under \"UMD Offense\"\n- Total rebounds = 15 (from UNC) + 34 (from UMD)\n- Total rebounds = 49\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>49</answer>",
