  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to analyze the pathways in the node-link diagram that lead to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes\nThere are two instances of the \"Discharge-Alive\" node in the diagram:\n- One in the second column (middle-left section)\n- One in the fourth column (right-middle section)\n\n### 2. Trace the pathways leading to each \"Discharge-Alive\" node\n#### Pathway to the first \"Discharge-Alive\" node (second column):\n- The pathway starts from the \"_Start\" node with a count of 37.\n- It goes through the \"Arrival\" node (count 37).\n- From \"Arrival,\" it proceeds to the \"Emergency\" node (count 37).\n- From \"Emergency,\" it directly leads to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node with a count of 37.\n\nThus, 37 patients follow this pathway to be discharged alive.\n\n#### Pathway to the second \"Discharge-Alive\" node (fourth column):\n- The pathway starts from the \"_Start\" node with a count of 24.\n- It goes through the \"Arrival\" node (count 24).\n- From \"Arrival,\" it proceeds to the \"Emergency\" node (count 24).\n- From \"Emergency,\" it goes to the \"Floor\" node (count 23).\n- From \"Floor,\" it proceeds to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node with a count of 20.\n\nThus, 20 patients follow this pathway to be discharged alive.\n\n### 3. Sum the counts of patients discharged alive\n- From the first \"Discharge-Alive\" node: 37 patients\n- From the second \"Discharge-Alive\" node: 20 patients\n\nTotal patients discharged alive = 37 + 20 = 57\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>57</answer>",
