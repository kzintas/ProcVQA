  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "15",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The diagram shows a sequence of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing events and directed links showing transitions between events.\n- The node labeled **UNC Offense** is the starting point for UNC's offensive possession.\n- The node labeled **UMD Offense** represents the transition to UMD's offensive possession.\n- The link connecting **UNC Offense** to **UMD Offense** indicates the number of times UMD gained possession after UNC's offensive possession.\n\n### 2. Locate the transition from UNC Offense to UMD Offense:\n- From the diagram, we can see a directed link from the **UNC Offense** node to the **UMD Offense** node.\n- The numeric label on this link is **15**.\n\n### 3. Interpret the link label:\n- The numeric label **15** on the link from **UNC Offense** to **UMD Offense** indicates that there were 15 sequences where UMD gained possession after UNC's offensive possession.\n\n### 4. Verify the context:\n- The **Rebound** node is connected to **UMD Offense** with a count of **15**, which aligns with the transition from **UNC Offense** to **UMD Offense**.\n- This confirms that the transition from UNC Offense to UMD Offense occurred 15 times.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The link from **UNC Offense** to **UMD Offense** is explicitly labeled with the number **15**.\n- This label directly represents the number of times UMD gained possession after UNC's offensive possession.\n- No other paths or additional information in the diagram contradicts or modifies this count.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>15</answer>",
