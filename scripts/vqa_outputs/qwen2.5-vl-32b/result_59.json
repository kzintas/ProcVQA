  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The **Start** node has 100 sequences leading to **Arrival**.\n- From **Arrival**, all 100 sequences lead to **Emergency**.\n- At **Emergency**, there are two pathways:\n  - 62 sequences lead to **ICU**.\n  - 38 sequences lead directly to **Discharge-Alive**.\n- From **ICU**, there are two pathways:\n  - 36 sequences lead to **Die**.\n  - 26 sequences lead to **Exit**.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway for patients who die:\n- Patients who die must follow the path from **Emergency** \u2192 **ICU** \u2192 **Die**.\n- The number of sequences leading from **Emergency** to **ICU** is 62.\n- From **ICU**, 36 sequences lead to **Die**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the number of patients who died:\n- The number of patients who died is the number of sequences leading from **ICU** to **Die**, which is explicitly labeled as 36.\n\n### 4. Verify the total flow:\n- From **Emergency**, 62 sequences go to **ICU** and 38 sequences go to **Discharge-Alive**.\n- From **ICU**, 36 sequences go to **Die** and 26 sequences go to **Exit**.\n- The total sequences from **Emergency** are:\n  - 62 (to ICU) + 38 (to Discharge-Alive) = 100.\n- The total sequences from **ICU** are:\n  - 36 (to Die) + 26 (to Exit) = 62.\n- This confirms the flow is consistent with the initial 100 sequences from **Start**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>36</answer>",
