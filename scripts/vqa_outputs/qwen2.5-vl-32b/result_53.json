  "full_response": "To answer the question \"How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?\", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant elements:\n- The starting point is the `_Start` node, which has 100 sequences.\n- The next node is `Arrival`, which also has 100 sequences, indicating all patients arrive.\n- From `Arrival`, patients proceed to `Emergency`, which also has 100 sequences.\n- From `Emergency`, there are two paths:\n  - One path leads to `Floor` with 21 sequences.\n  - Another path leads directly to `Discharge-Alive` with 38 sequences.\n- From `Floor`, there are two paths:\n  - One path leads to `ICU` with 41 sequences.\n  - Another path leads directly to `Discharge-Alive` with 21 sequences.\n- From `ICU`, there are two paths:\n  - One path leads to `Floor` with 24 sequences.\n  - Another path leads to `Die` with 36 sequences.\n- From `Floor` (after ICU), there is one path to `Discharge-Alive` with 24 sequences.\n- From `Die`, there is one path to `_Exit` with 21 sequences.\n\n### 2. Trace the pathway to determine deaths:\n- The only node that leads to `_Exit` (indicating death) is `Die`.\n- The number of sequences leading to `Die` is 36.\n- Therefore, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.\n\n### 3. Verify the flow:\n- All 100 patients start at `_Start`.\n- All 100 patients arrive at `Arrival`.\n- All 100 patients proceed to `Emergency`.\n- From `Emergency`, 21 patients go to `Floor`, and 38 patients are discharged alive.\n- From `Floor`, 41 patients go to `ICU`, and 21 patients are discharged alive.\n- From `ICU`, 24 patients return to `Floor`, and 36 patients die.\n- From `Floor` (after ICU), 24 patients are discharged alive.\n- From `Die`, 21 patients exit (indicating death).\n\n### 4. Final Answer:\nThe number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the number of sequences leading to `Die`, which is 36.\n\n<answer>36</answer>",
