  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "To answer the question, we need to analyze the node-link diagram and identify the pathways that specifically involve the UNC offense leading to a \"Made Shot.\" Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant nodes and links:\n- The diagram shows sequences starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`.\n- We are interested in the paths where the UNC offense leads directly to a \"Made Shot.\"\n\n### 2. Trace the UNC offense pathways:\n- The UNC offense is represented by the orange-colored node labeled \"UNC Offense.\"\n- From the `_Start` node, there are three branches:\n  - One branch leads to \"Jump Ball\" (1 sequence).\n  - Two branches lead to \"UNC Offense\" (19 sequences and 33 sequences).\n\n### 3. Focus on the UNC Offense branches:\n- The branch with 19 sequences from `_Start` to \"UNC Offense\" leads to:\n  - \"Missed Shot\" (19 sequences).\n  - This does not contribute to made shots.\n  \n- The branch with 33 sequences from `_Start` to \"UNC Offense\" leads to:\n  - \"Made Shot\" (28 sequences).\n  - \"Missed Shot\" (5 sequences, but we are only interested in made shots).\n\n### 4. Count the made shots by UNC Offense:\n- The direct path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has 28 sequences.\n\n### 5. Verify other potential paths:\n- There are no other branches from \"UNC Offense\" that lead to \"Made Shot\" in this diagram.\n- Other branches (e.g., UMD Offense) are not relevant to the UNC offense.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of shots made by only the UNC offense is explicitly shown as 28.\n\n<answer>28</answer>",
