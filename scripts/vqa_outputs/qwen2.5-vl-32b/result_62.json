One link to **ICU** with a numeric label of **62**.\n  2. Another link to **Discharge-Alive** with a numeric label of **38**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the meaning of the numeric labels\n- The numeric labels next to the links represent the number of sequences (or patients, in this context) that follow each path.\n- The link from **Emergency** to **ICU** is labeled **62**, indicating that 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the pathway\n- Starting from **_Start**, all patients proceed to **Arrival** (100 patients).\n- From **Arrival**, all patients proceed to **Emergency** (100 patients).\n- At **Emergency**, the patients split into two groups:\n  - 62 patients go to **ICU**.\n  - 38 patients go to **Discharge-Alive**.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the question\nThe question asks how many patients went to the ICU after Emergency. Based on the link from **Emergency** to **ICU**, the answer is explicitly provided as **62**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<answer>62</answer>",
