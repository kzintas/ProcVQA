From \"UMD Offense\", there are two pathways: one leading to \"Rebound\" and the other directly to \"_Exit\". There is no node or label in the diagram that explicitly mentions \"Fouls\". Therefore, based on the information provided in the visualization, it is not possible to determine the number of Fouls made by UMD Offense.",
