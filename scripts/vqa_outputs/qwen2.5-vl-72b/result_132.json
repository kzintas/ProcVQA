  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense, we need to look at the direct links coming out of the \"UMD Offense\" node. There are two links: one leading to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 and another leading to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 21. Since the question specifically asks for the number of shots that were missed immediately after UMD Offense, we focus on the link leading to \"Missed Shot\". The numeric label on this link indicates the count of sequences following this path, which is 21.",
