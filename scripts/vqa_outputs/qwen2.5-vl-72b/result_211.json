  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but not after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "21",
  "llm_answer": "7",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- In the first diagram, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 7.\n      - In the second diagram, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" (14) and then to \"Missed Shot\" (14). This means all 14 missed shots after UNC Offense also involve UMD Offense, so we exclude these.\n      - In the third diagram, there is no direct path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot.\" The only path involving \"Missed Shot\" goes through \"UMD Offense,\" which we are excluding.\n      - In the fourth diagram, there is no path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot.\"\n      - In the fifth diagram, there is no path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot.\"\n   \n      Therefore, the only valid path is the one in the first diagram with a count of 7.",
  "full_response": "1. **Identify relevant elements:**\n   - We need to focus on paths starting with \"UNC Offense\" and ending in \"Missed Shot.\"\n   - We should exclude any paths that involve \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n2. <reasoning>\n      - In the first diagram, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 7.\n      - In the second diagram, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Rebound\" (14) and then to \"Missed Shot\" (14).
