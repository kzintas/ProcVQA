  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game. The nodes represent different game states, and the links show transitions between these states with their respective counts.\n\n1. Identify the relevant elements:\n   - The \"UMD Offense\" node represents when UMD has possession of the ball.\n   - There are two outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\": one to \"Rebound\" (34) and one to \"_Exit\" (35).\n\n2. Analyze the pathways:\n   - A steal would typically result in a change of possession, leading to the opposing team's offense or an exit from the current sequence.\n   - In this diagram, there is no explicit node for \"Steal\".\n   - The link to \"Rebound\" suggests that UMD lost possession due to a missed shot or turnover, but it does not specify if it was a steal.\n   - The link to \"_Exit\" could indicate various endings, including a steal, but it is not specified.\n\n3. Conclusion:\n   - The diagram does not provide specific information about steals occurring after UMD Offense.\n   - Without a dedicated node or label for steals, we cannot determine the exact number of steals from this visualization.",
