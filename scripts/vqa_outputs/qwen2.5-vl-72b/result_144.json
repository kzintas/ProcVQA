  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows a sequence of events related to offensive plays by UNC and UMD. The nodes represent different events such as \"Rebound,\" \"Made Shot,\" \"Missed Shot,\" etc., and the links show the flow between these events with numerical labels indicating the number of sequences.\n\nTo answer the question about free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to look for any nodes or links that explicitly mention \"free throw\" or a similar term. However, there are no nodes or links in the diagram that refer to free throws. The diagram only shows general offensive outcomes like rebounds, made shots, and missed shots.\n\nSince there is no information about free throws in the visualization, it is not possible to determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense.",
