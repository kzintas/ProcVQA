The nodes present are _Start, Arrival, Emergency, ICU, Die, Discharge-Alive, and _Exit. There is no pathway leading from ICU to a node named \"Floor\". Therefore, based on the information explicitly shown in the visualization, it is not possible to determine how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
