  "reasoning": "- To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to sum the counts of all other transitions from UMD Offense.\n      - From UMD Offense:\n        - 14 sequences went to Missed Shot.\n        - 10 sequences went to Foul.\n        - 8 sequences went to Made Shot.\n      - Adding these values: 14 + 10 + 8 = 32.\n      - Therefore, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 32 times.",
