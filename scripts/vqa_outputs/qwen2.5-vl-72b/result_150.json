  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- The question asks for the total shots made by UMD offense.\n      - In this context, a \"shot made\" can be inferred as an event that does not result in a rebound but instead leads to an exit (successful shot).\n      - Therefore, the path from `UMD Offense` to `_Exit` represents the successful shots made by UMD.\n      - The value on this path is 35, indicating 35 successful shots.\n      - The path to `Rebound` (34) represents missed shots or other events that did not result in a successful shot.",
  "full_response": "1. **Identify the relevant elements:**\n   - The diagram shows a sequence starting from `_Start` and passing through `UNC Offense`, then `UMD Offense`.\n   - From `UMD Offense`, there are two paths: one leading to `Rebound` and another to `_Exit`.\n   - The link from `UMD Offense` to `Rebound` is labeled with 34.\n   - The link from `UMD Offense` to `_Exit` is labeled with 35.\n\n2. **Reasoning:**\n   <reasoning>\n      - The question asks for the total shots made by UMD offense.\n      - In this context, a \"shot made\" can be inferred as an event that does not result in a rebound but instead leads to an exit (successful shot).\n      - Therefore, the path from `UMD Offense` to `_Exit` represents the successful shots made by UMD.\n      - The value on this path is 35, indicating 35 successful shots.\n      - The path to `Rebound` (34) represents missed shots or other events that did not result in a successful shot.\n   </reasoning>\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   <answer>35</answer>",
