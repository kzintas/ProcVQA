  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- The question asks for the total shots made by UMD offense.\n      - In this context, a \"shot made\" can be inferred as a successful play that does not result in a rebound but instead leads to an exit (successful completion of the offensive play).\n      - The path from `UMD Offense` to `_Exit` represents these successful plays, with a count of 35.\n      - The path to `Rebound` indicates unsuccessful plays where the ball was recovered, which is not considered a shot made.",
