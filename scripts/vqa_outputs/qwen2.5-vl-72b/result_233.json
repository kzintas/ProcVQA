  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of rebounds, I identified all \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram. There were two such nodes, one with a value of 19 and another with a value of 15. Adding these values together gives the total number of rebounds made by both teams.",
  "full_response": "1. **Identify the relevant elements:**\n   - Look for nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram.\n   - There are two instances of \"Rebound\" nodes.\n\n2. **Analyze the values associated with these nodes:**\n   - The first \"Rebound\" node has a value of 19.\n   - The second \"Rebound\" node has a value of 15.\n\n3. **Calculate the total rebounds:**\n   - Add the values of both \"Rebound\" nodes: 19 + 15 = 34\n\n<reasoning>\nTo determine the total number of rebounds, I identified all \"Rebound\" nodes in the diagram.
