  "reasoning": "- Starting from the \"UMD Offense\" node, we need to follow all possible pathways to see if a \"Steal\" event occurs.\n    - From \"UMD Offense,\" there are several paths:\n        - Path 1: UMD Offense -> Missed Shot -> Rebound -> Made Shot (7 sequences)\n        - Path 2: UMD Offense -> Missed Shot -> Rebound -> Foul -> Made Free Throw (4 sequences)\n        - Path 3: UMD Offense -> Missed Shot -> Rebound -> Turnover (4 sequences)\n        - Path 4: UMD Offense -> Missed Shot -> _Exit (9 sequences)\n        - Path 5: UMD Offense -> Foul -> Made Free Throw -> _Exit (8 sequences)\n        - Path 6: UMD Offense -> Steal (4 sequences)\n    - Among these paths, only Path 6 directly leads to a \"Steal\" event after \"UMD Offense.\"\n    - The number of sequences following this path is explicitly labeled as 4.",
