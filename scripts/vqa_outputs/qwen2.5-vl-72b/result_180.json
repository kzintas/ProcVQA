However, the node-link diagram does not contain any nodes or links labeled \"Foul\" or anything related to fouls. The diagram only shows events such as \"Made Shot,\" \"Missed Shot,\" \"Rebound,\" and transitions between offenses. Since there is no information about fouls in the visualization, it is not possible to determine the number of fouls based on this diagram.",
