  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- We need to find the number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n      - From the diagram, there are two pathways from the Floor that lead to Discharge-Alive:\n        1. Directly from Floor to Discharge-Alive with a count of 38.\n        2. From Floor to ICU (count 24) and then from ICU to Discharge-Alive (count 24).\n      - The second pathway involves patients who went to the ICU before being discharged alive. However, the link from ICU to Discharge-Alive already includes these patients in its count of 24.\n      - Therefore, we only need to consider the direct path from Floor to Discharge-Alive which is 38.",
