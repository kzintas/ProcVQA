  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two direct paths leading to \"Made Shot\":\n        - One path has a count of 8.\n      - Another path goes through \"Rebound\" and then splits:\n        - From \"Rebound,\" one path leads to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n      - Summing these counts gives the total number of made shots by UMD offense.\n      - Calculation: 8 (direct) + 15 (via Rebound) = 23",
