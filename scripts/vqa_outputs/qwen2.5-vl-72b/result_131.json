  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to focus on the paths that do not lead to \"Rebound.\"\n      - From the diagram, there is only one path from UMD Offense that does not lead to \"Rebound,\" which is the path leading to \"Missed Shot.\"\n      - The count for this path is explicitly labeled as 14.\n      - Therefore, UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound 14 times.",
