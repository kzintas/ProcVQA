  "reasoning": "To determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to sum the number of sequences that follow each path leading to UMD Offense:\n      - From \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\": 22 sequences\n      - From \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\": 24 sequences\n      Adding these values gives us the total transitions: 22 + 24 = 46.",
