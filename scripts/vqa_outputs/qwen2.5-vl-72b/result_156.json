  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- A rebound typically occurs when a shot is missed, as it represents the act of gaining possession of the ball after a missed shot.\n      - The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34 suggests that there were 34 instances where a shot was missed immediately after UMD's offense.\n      - The link to \"_Exit\" does not indicate a missed shot but rather an end to the sequence without a rebound, so it is not relevant to the question.",
