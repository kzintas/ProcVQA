  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "27",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "1. **Relevant Elements:**\n   - The nodes \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" mark the start of each team's offensive sequences.\n   - We need to focus on the pathways originating from \"UNC Offense\" and ending before reaching \"UMD Offense\".\n   - The node \"Made Shot\" is relevant as it represents successful scoring plays.\n\n2. **Reasoning:**\n   - From \"UNC Offense\", there are several paths:\n     - One path leads directly to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 27.\n     - Other paths lead to \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", or \"Turnover\", which do not result in a made shot.\n   - The \"Made Shot\" node (with a count of 27) connects directly to \"UMD Offense\", indicating that these shots were made by UNC before UMD's offense began.\n   - No other paths between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" include a \"Made Shot\".\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n<answer>27</answer>",
