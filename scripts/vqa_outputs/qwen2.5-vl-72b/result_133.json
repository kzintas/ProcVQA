  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a Rebound.\n      - From the diagram, we can see that there is only one path from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".\n      - The link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" has a value of 15, indicating that 15 sequences followed this path.\n      - No other paths exist from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\", so the count of 15 represents all the shots made directly after a rebound.",
