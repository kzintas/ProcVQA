  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- From the \"Emergency\" node, 62 patients go to \"ICU.\"\n     - Of these, 36 die, leaving 26.\n     - Of the remaining 26, 24 go to \"Floor,\" and all 24 are discharged alive.\n   - Additionally, 38 patients bypass \"ICU\" and \"Floor\" and are directly discharged alive.\n   - To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we sum the counts from both paths:\n     - 24 (from ICU -> Floor) + 38 (directly from Emergency) = 62",
