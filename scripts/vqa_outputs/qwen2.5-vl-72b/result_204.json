  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "21",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- In the first column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" (7) to \"Missed Shot\" (7). This leads to \"Rebound\" (7) and then to \"UMD Offense\" (7).\n   - In the second column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" (14) to \"Missed Shot\" (14). This leads to \"Rebound\" (14) and then to \"UMD Offense\" (7).\n\n   - Adding the counts of \"Missed Shot\" in these paths:\n     - First column: 7\n     - Second column: 14\n\n   - Total missed shots = 7 + 14 = 21",
