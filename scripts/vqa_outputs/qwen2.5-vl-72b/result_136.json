  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The node-link diagram shows a sequence of events related to UNC and UMD Offense. The nodes represent different events, and the links show the flow between these events with their respective counts.\n\n1. The diagram starts with \"_Start\" and flows into \"UNC Offense\" with 69 sequences.\n2. From \"UNC Offense,\" it moves to \"UMD Offense\" with the same 69 sequences.\n3. From \"UMD Offense,\" there are two branches:\n   - One branch leads to \"Rebound\" with 34 sequences.\n   - Another branch leads to \"Missed Shot\" with 14 sequences, which further leads to \"_Exit\" with 14 sequences.\n4. From \"Rebound,\" there are two more branches:\n   - One leads to \"Made Shot\" with 15 sequences, which then goes to \"_Exit\" with 15 sequences.\n   - The other leads directly to \"_Exit\" with 19 sequences.\n\nThere is no mention of \"free throws\" in any of the nodes or labels. Therefore, based on the information provided in the visualization, we cannot determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.",
