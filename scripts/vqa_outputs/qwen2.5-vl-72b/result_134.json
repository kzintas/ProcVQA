  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- To determine the total shots made by UMD offense, we need to focus on the path that leads to a \"Made Shot\".\n      - From the diagram, the only path leading to a \"Made Shot\" starts from \"UMD Offense\", goes through \"Rebound\", and ends at \"Made Shot\".\n      - The link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" has a value of 15, indicating that 15 sequences followed this path.\n      - There are no other paths in the diagram that lead to a \"Made Shot\". Therefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is equal to the value on this single path.",
  "full_response": "1. **Relevant Elements:**\n   - The node \"UMD Offense\" branches into two paths: \"Rebound\" and \"Missed Shot\".\n   - The \"Rebound\" path further splits into \"Made Shot\" and \"_Exit\".\n   - The link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is labeled with the value 15.\n\n2. <reasoning>\n      - To determine the total shots made by UMD offense, we need to focus on the path that leads to a \"Made Shot\".\n      - From the diagram, the only path leading to a \"Made Shot\" starts from \"UMD Offense\", goes through \"Rebound\", and ends at \"Made Shot\".\n      - The link between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" has a value of 15, indicating that 15 sequences followed this path.\n      - There are no other paths in the diagram that lead to a \"Made Shot\".
