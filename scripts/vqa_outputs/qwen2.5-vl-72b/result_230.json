  "question": "How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?",
  "true_answer": "28",
  "llm_answer": "28",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- In the first pathway, there are 2 sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\". However, this pathway does not lead to a \"Made Shot\".\n      - In the second pathway, there are 19 sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\". This pathway leads to a \"Missed Shot\" (19) and then a \"Rebound\" (19). It does not lead directly to a \"Made Shot\".\n      - In the third pathway, there are 33 sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\". This pathway leads to a \"Made Shot\" (28), which is the only direct path from UNC Offense to a Made Shot.\n      - The fourth pathway starts with \"UNC Offense\" but leads to a \"Foul\" and not a \"Made Shot\".\n      - Therefore, the only pathway where UNC Offense directly leads to a \"Made Shot\" is in the third pathway, with 28 sequences.",
  "full_response": "1. **Relevant Elements:**\n   - The diagram shows four separate pathways starting from `_Start`.\n   - We need to focus on the pathway that starts with \"UNC Offense\" and ends with a \"Made Shot\".\n\n2. <reasoning>\n      - In the first pathway, there are 2 sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\".
