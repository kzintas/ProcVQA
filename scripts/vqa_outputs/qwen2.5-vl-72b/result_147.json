  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to focus on the paths that do not lead to \"Rebound\". \n      - From UMD Offense, there are two possible transitions: one to \"Rebound\" and one to \"_Exit\".\n      - The link from UMD Offense to \"_Exit\" is labeled with the number 35, indicating that this path was taken 35 times.\n      - Therefore, these 35 instances represent the times when UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound.",
