  "llm_answer": "27",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- From the UMD Offense node, there is a direct link to the Rebound node with a numeric label of 27.\n   - This indicates that 27 sequences followed the path from UMD Offense directly to Rebound.\n   - There are no other paths originating from UMD Offense that lead to Rebound through intermediate nodes.\n   - Therefore, the total number of rebounds made after UMD Offense is the sum of all sequences leading directly from UMD Offense to Rebound, which is 27.",
