  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",

  "reasoning": "- In the first column, there is no UMD Offense event.\n      - In the second column, there is no UMD Offense event.\n      - In the third column, there is no UMD Offense event.\n      - In the fourth column, there is a UMD Offense event with 10 sequences leading to it. From this UMD Offense, there are two paths: one leading to \"Made Shot\" (3 sequences) and another leading to \"Foul\" (9 sequences). The \"Foul\" path then leads to \"Made Free Throw\" (6 sequences).\n      - In the fifth column, there is a UMD Offense event with 8 sequences leading to it. This UMD Offense does not lead to any \"Made Free Throw\".\n      - In the sixth column, there is a UMD Offense event with 15 sequences leading to it. This UMD Offense does not lead to any \"Made Free Throw\".\n      - Therefore, the only \"Made Free Throw\" associated with UMD Offense is from the fourth column, which has 6 sequences.",
