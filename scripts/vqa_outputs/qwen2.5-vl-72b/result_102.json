  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "47",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- In the first pathway (leftmost), 12 patients went from \"Emergency\" directly to \"Die,\" with no ICU involvement.\n      - In the second pathway, 37 patients went from \"Emergency\" directly to \"Discharge-Alive,\" with no ICU involvement.\n      - In the third pathway, 24 patients went from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" (23) and \"Floor\" (23). This means 23 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.\n      - In the fourth pathway, 27 patients went from \"Emergency\" to \"Floor\" (27) and then to \"ICU\" (24). This means 24 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.\n\n      - Adding the patients who went to ICU after Emergency in the third and fourth pathways: 23 + 24 = 47",
  "full_response": "1. **Relevant Elements:**\n   - The diagram shows four separate pathways starting from \"_Start.\"\n   - Each pathway includes nodes labeled \"Emergency\" and potentially \"ICU.\"\n   - We need to focus on the pathways where \"Emergency\" is followed by \"ICU.\"\n\n2. <reasoning>\n      - In the first pathway (leftmost), 12 patients went from \"Emergency\" directly to \"Die,\" with no ICU involvement.\n      - In the second pathway, 37 patients went from \"Emergency\" directly to \"Discharge-Alive,\" with no ICU involvement.\n      - In the third pathway, 24 patients went from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\" (23) and \"Floor\" (23).
