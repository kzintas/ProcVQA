  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",

  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "- In the first column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" (count 14), but it does not lead to \"UMD Offense,\" so this is irrelevant.\n   - In the second column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" (count 14) followed by \"Rebound\" (count 14) and then \"UMD Offense\" (count 13). This matches our criteria.\n   - In the third column, there is no \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense.\"\n   - In the fourth column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Steal\" (count 6) and then \"UMD Offense\" (count 10), but no \"Missed Shot\" in between.\n   - In the fifth column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" (count 9) followed by \"UMD Offense\" (count 8). This also matches our criteria.\n   - In the sixth column, there is no \"Missed Shot\" before \"UMD Offense.\"\n\n   Therefore, the total number of missed shots after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense is 14 + 9 = 23.",
  "full_response": "1. **Identify the relevant elements:**\n   - We need to focus on paths that start with \"UNC Offense\" and end with \"UMD Offense.\"\n   - We are looking for \"Missed Shot\" events that occur between these two.\n\n2. <reasoning>\n   - In the first column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" (count 14), but it does not lead to \"UMD Offense,\" so this is irrelevant.\n   - In the second column, there is a path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" (count 14) followed by \"Rebound\" (count 14) and then \"UMD Offense\" (count 13).
