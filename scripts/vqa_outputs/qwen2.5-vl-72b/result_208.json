  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "- In the first column, there is a path from \"_Start\" (4) to \"UNC Offense\" (4), then to \"Foul\" (3). This path does not involve UMD Offense.\n      - In the second column, there is a path from \"_Start\" (15) to \"UNC Offense\" (15), then to \"Foul\" (15), and finally to \"Made Free Throw\" (13). This path involves UMD Offense after the foul.\n      - There is another path in the same column from \"Foul\" (15) to \"Made Free Throw\" (8). This also involves UMD Offense.\n      - Adding these two values gives us the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense: 13 + 8 = 21.",
