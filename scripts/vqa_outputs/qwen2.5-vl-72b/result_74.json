  "reasoning": "- In the first pathway (leftmost):\n        - 12 patients went from \"_Start\" to \"Arrival\".\n        - All 12 patients went from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\".\n        - All 12 patients went from \"Emergency\" to \"ICU\".\n      \n      - In the second pathway:\n        - There is no \"ICU\" node after \"Emergency\".
