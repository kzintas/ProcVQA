  "reasoning": "- The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a Rebound.\n      - In the diagram, \"Rebound\" is a node that follows \"UMD Offense.\"\n      - There is no direct link from \"Rebound\" to any other node except \"_Exit,\" which indicates the end of the sequence.\n      - Since there is no node representing a \"shot made\" following \"Rebound,\" we cannot determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound based on this visualization.",
