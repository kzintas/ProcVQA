  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. According to the diagram:\n\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are two pathways: one leading to \"ICU\" and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n2. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a label of 38, indicating that 38 patients were discharged alive.\n\nSince this is the only pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive,\" the total number of patients discharged alive is simply the value on the link connecting \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.",
