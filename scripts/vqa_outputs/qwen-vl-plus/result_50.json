From Floor, there are two paths: one leading to \"ICU\" and another leading to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\nSince the question asks specifically about the path to ICU, we focus on the link labeled \"21\" from Floor to ICU.\n\nTherefore, the number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency is 21.",
