  "true_answer": "20",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Arrival to Floor and then to Discharge-Alive. \n\n1. Start at _Start.\n2. Follow the orange link labeled 24 to Arrival.\n3. Continue with the green link labeled 23 to Floor.\n4. Finally, take the pink link labeled 20 to Discharge-Alive.\n\nAdding these numbers together: 24 (Arrival) + 23 (Floor) + 20 (Discharge-Alive) = 67.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we only consider the last step in the sequence, which is Discharge-Alive. Therefore, the correct answer is 20 patients.",
