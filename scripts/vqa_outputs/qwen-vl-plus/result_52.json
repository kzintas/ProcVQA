  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "65",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Emergency, then to Floor, and finally to Discharge-Alive.\n\n1. Start at _Start with 100 patients.\n2. Move to Emergency with 100 patients.\n3. From Emergency, there are two pathways: one leading to Floor with 41 patients and another leading to ICU with 21 patients.\n4. For the pathway that leads to Floor, we have 41 patients.\n5. For the pathway that leads to ICU, we have 21 patients.\n6. From Floor, there is a direct path to Discharge-Alive with 24 patients.\n\nAdding these together: \n100 (Emergency) + 41 (Floor) + 24 (Discharge-Alive) = 165\n\nHowever, this calculation includes patients who died in the ICU, which we need to exclude for the final count of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor.\n\nSo, we subtract the patients who died in the ICU:\n165 - 21 (ICU deaths) = 144\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the diagram carefully:\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears there might be an error in the interpretation or labeling of the diagram. The correct approach should be to sum up all the patients who reached the Discharge-Alive state directly from the Floor without considering the ICU pathway.\n\nSumming up correctly:\n100 (Emergency) + 41 (Floor) + 24 (Discharge-Alive) = 165\n\nThis matches option B (165), so the correct answer is 165 patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor.",
