  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Emergency and then to Discharge-Alive. \n\n1. Start at _Start with 100 patients.\n2. Move to Emergency with 100 patients.\n3. From Emergency, there are two pathways: one leading to ICU and another leading directly to Discharge-Alive.\n\n   - The pathway to ICU has 62 patients.\n   - The direct pathway to Discharge-Alive has 38 patients.\n\n4. Summing these values gives us the total number of patients who were discharged alive:\n   \\( 62 + 38 = 100 \\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 100.",
