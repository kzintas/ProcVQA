  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathways from the \"Start\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes. \n\n1. From the \"Start\" node, there are 100 patients who arrive at the Emergency department.\n2. Out of these, 38 patients are discharged alive after going through the \"Emergency\" and then the \"Discharge-Alive\" pathway.\n3. Additionally, 24 patients go directly from the \"Start\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" without passing through the Emergency or ICU.\n\nAdding these two groups together: \n38 (from Emergency) + 24 (directly from Start) = 62 patients were discharged alive in total.",
