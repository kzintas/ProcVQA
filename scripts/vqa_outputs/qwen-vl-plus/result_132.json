Start at the node labeled \"UMD Offense.\"\n2. Follow the directed link with a label of \"14\" leading to the node labeled \"Missed Shot.\"\n\nThe link width and numeric label next to it indicate that 14 sequences of events followed this path directly from UMD Offense to Missed Shot. Therefore, the answer is 14.",
