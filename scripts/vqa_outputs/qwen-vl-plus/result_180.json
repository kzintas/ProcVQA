Start at \"UNC Offense\".\n2. Follow the link labeled \"Made Shot\" which leads to \"Rebound\".\n3. Next, follow the link labeled \"Rebound\" which leads to \"Missed Shot\".\n4. Finally, follow the link labeled \"Missed Shot\" which leads directly to \"Exit\".\n\nSince there are no links or labels indicating a foul event between \"Made Shot\" and \"Rebound\", it can be concluded that no fouls were made during this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.",
