  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Arrival to Emergency and then to Discharge-Alive. \n\n1. Start at _Start with 12 patients.\n2. Move to Arrival with 37 patients.\n3. Continue to Emergency with 24 patients.\n4. Finally, reach Discharge-Alive with 20 patients.\n\nAdding these numbers together: 12 (Start) + 37 (Arrival) + 24 (Emergency) + 20 (Discharge-Alive) = 93 patients.\n\nHowever, since the question asks specifically about patients who went to the Floor, we should only consider the sequence that includes Floor. The correct sequence is:\n1. Start\n2. Arrival\n3. Emergency\n4. Floor\n\nFollowing this path, we have:\n1. Start with 12 patients.\n2. Arrival with 24 patients.\n3. Emergency with 24 patients.\n4. Floor with 23 patients.\n\nAdding these numbers together: 12 (Start) + 24 (Arrival) + 24 (Emergency) + 23 (Floor) = 83 patients.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 83.",
