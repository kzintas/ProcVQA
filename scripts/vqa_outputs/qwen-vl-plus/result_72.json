  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from \"Start\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" and then to \"_Exit\". \n\n1. The pathway starts at \"Start\" with 37 patients.\n2. From \"Start\", there are two pathways leading to \"Emergency\" (12 patients) and \"ICU\" (12 patients).\n3. From \"Emergency\", there is one pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" (37 patients).\n4. From \"ICU\", there is one pathway leading to \"Floor\" (23 patients), and another pathway leading to \"Discharge-Alive\" (23 patients).\n\nAdding these together: \n- Emergency: 12 patients\n- ICU: 23 patients + 23 patients = 46 patients\n\nSo, the total number of patients who were discharged alive is 37 (from Emergency) + 46 (from ICU) = 83 patients.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive, and the diagram shows that only 20 patients actually followed this specific pathway, the correct answer is 20.",
