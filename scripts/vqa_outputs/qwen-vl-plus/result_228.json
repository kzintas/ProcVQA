  "question": "How many total missed shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "39",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the diagram. \n\n1. Start with the first Missed Shot node at the top left corner.\n2. Count each subsequent Missed Shot node moving down and across the diagram.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- There are 2 Missed Shot nodes for UNC Offense.\n- There are 2 Missed Shot nodes for UMD Offense.\n\nAdding these together: \n2 (UNC) + 2 (UMD) = 4 Missed Shots\n\nHowever, there is an additional Missed Shot node that appears twice in the diagram, indicating it is part of a sequence involving another event. This node is connected to the Rebound node and has a label of \"Missed Shot\" with a numeric value of 19.\n\nSince this node is counted once for each sequence it appears in, we add it to our total:\n\n4 (initial count) + 19 (additional count) = 23 Missed Shots\n\nBut there's one more Missed Shot node that appears twice in the diagram, which is connected to the Made Shot node and has a label of \"Missed Shot\" with a numeric value of 7.\n\nAgain, since this node is counted once for each sequence it appears in, we add it to our total:\n\n23 (previous total) + 7 (additional count) = 30 Missed Shots\n\nFinally, there is one more Missed Shot node that appears twice in the diagram, which is connected to the _Exit node and has a label of \"Missed Shot\" with a numeric value of 18.\n\nAdding this to our total:\n\n30 (previous total) + 18 (additional count) = 48 Missed Shots\n\nHowever, upon reevaluation, it appears there was an error in the initial calculation. The correct approach should be to count each instance of \"Missed Shot\" node directly without adding them as separate counts. \n\nLet's correct this:\n\nThere are 2 instances of \"Missed Shot\" for UNC Offense.\nThere are 2 instances of \"Missed Shot\" for UMD Offense.\nThere are 1 instance of \"Missed Shot\" for _Exit.\n\nAdding these together correctly:\n\n2 (UNC) + 2 (UMD) + 1 (_Exit) = 5 Missed Shots\n\nTherefore, the total number of missed shots made by both teams is 5.",
