Start at the \"Arrival\" node.\n2. Follow the link labeled with the number 12, which connects \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\".\n3. From \"Emergency\", follow the link labeled with the number 37, which leads to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThe link width between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is 37, indicating that there are 37 sequences where patients get discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
