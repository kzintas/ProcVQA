Start at the \"Arrival\" node.\n2. Follow the link labeled with the number 12 to the \"Emergency\" node.\n3. From the \"Emergency\" node, follow the link labeled with the number 37 to the \"Discharge-Alive Exit\" node.\n\nThe label next to the link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive Exit\" is 37, which indicates that there are 37 sequences where patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
