The link width between Start and UMD Offense is labeled with the number 69, which indicates that there are 69 sequences following this path. Since each sequence represents a single event, and the question asks for the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense, we can infer that the number of Fouls made by UMD Offense is equal to the label on the link connecting Start to UMD Offense.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense is 69.",
