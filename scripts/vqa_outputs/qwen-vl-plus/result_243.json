Start: The first node is \"Start\".\n2. Next, we look for the link leading from \"Start\" to \"UMD Offense\". This link has a label of 8, indicating that there are 8 sequences starting with UMD Offense.\n3. Following the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\", we find that this link has a label of 6.\n\nSince the label next to the link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\" is 6, it indicates that in 6 out of the 8 sequences where UMD Offense occurs, a free throw was made. Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 6.",
