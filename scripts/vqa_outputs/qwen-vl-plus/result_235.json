Look at the nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" for both teams.\n2. Count the occurrences of each team's \"Missed Shot\" node.\n\nFor UNC:\n- There are 2 instances of \"Missed Shot\" (nodes with red labels).\n\nFor UMD:\n- There are 19 instances of \"Missed Shot\" (nodes with red labels).\n\nAdding these together: \n2 (UNC) + 19 (UMD) = 21\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the provided answer as it states \"38\".
