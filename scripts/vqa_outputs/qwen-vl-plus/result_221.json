  "question": "How many total missed shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "39",
  "llm_answer": "37",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the diagram. \n\n1. First, identify all the nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\":\n   - There are two instances of \"Missed Shot\" for UNC Offense.\n   - There is one instance of \"Missed Shot\" for UMD Offense.\n\n2. Count the occurrences:\n   - UNC Offense: 2 instances\n   - UMD Offense: 1 instance\n\n3. Sum the counts:\n   - Total Missed Shots = 2 (UNC) + 1 (UMD) = 3\n\nHowever, there seems to be a discrepancy as the question asks for the total number of missed shots made by both teams, but the diagram only shows individual instances for each team. Assuming the question intends to ask for the sum of all instances of \"Missed Shot\" regardless of team, the correct answer would be:\n\nTotal Missed Shots = 2 (UNC) + 1 (UMD) = 3\n\nBut since the question specifies \"both teams,\" and the diagram does not provide enough information to accurately calculate the total for both teams based on the given data, the answer remains indeterminate.",
