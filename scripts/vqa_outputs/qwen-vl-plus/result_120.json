Start: 69 sequences\n2. UNC Offense: 69 sequences (not relevant for UMD Offense)\n3. UMD Offense: 34 sequences\n4. Rebound: 14 sequences\n5. Missed Shot: 14 sequences\n6. Foul: 14 sequences\n7. Turnover: 4 sequences\n8. Made Free Throw _Exit: 6 sequences\n\nThe link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw _Exit\" has a label of 6, indicating that there were 6 sequences where UMD Offense resulted in a made free throw.\n\nTherefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 6.",
