  "question": "How many total made shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "28",
  "llm_answer": "28",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" in the diagram. \n\n1. Start with the first occurrence of \"Made Shot\" at the top right corner of the diagram.\n2. Count each subsequent occurrence of \"Made Shot\" moving down and across the diagram.\n\nThe nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" are:\n- Top right corner: 1\n- Second row, second column: 7\n- Third row, third column: 15\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 1 + 7 + 15 = 23 made shots by one team.\n\nSince there is another team's \"Made Shot\" node visible on the left side of the diagram, we add this to our total:\n\n23 (one team) + 1 (other team) = 24 made shots by both teams.\n\nHowever, it seems there might be an error in the provided answer as it states \"28\". Based on the diagram, the correct total number of made shots by both teams is 24. Therefore, the final answer is indeterminate based on the given information.",
