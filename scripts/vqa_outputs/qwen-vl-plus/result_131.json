  "full_response": "<answer>21</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to look at the pathways from UMD Offense. The diagram shows two paths diverging from UMD Offense: one leading to Rebound and another leading to Missed Shot.\n\n- The path to Rebound has a label of 34.\n- The path to Missed Shot has a label of 14.\n\nSince there are 69 sequences starting with UMD Offense (as indicated by the vertical bar), we can calculate the number of sequences that did not transition to a Rebound by subtracting the number of sequences that did transition to a Rebound from the total sequences:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Sequences} - \\text{Sequences to Rebound} = 69 - 34 = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, 35 times out of the 69 sequences starting with UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound.",
