Start: 37 patients\n2. Emergency: 37 patients (all start events are connected to emergency)\n3. Discharge-Alive: 37 patients (all emergency events are connected to discharge-alive)\n4. _Exit: 24 patients (all discharge-alive events are connected to exit)\n\nAdding these numbers together gives us a total of 20 patients who were discharged alive.",
