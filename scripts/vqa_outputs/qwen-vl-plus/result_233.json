  "question": "How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to count the occurrences of the \"Rebound\" event in the diagram. \n\n1. Identify all nodes labeled \"Rebound\":\n   - There are two instances of \"Rebound\" for UNC Offense.\n   - There is one instance of \"Rebound\" for UMD Offense.\n\n2. Sum the occurrences:\n   - UNC Offense: 2\n   - UMD Offense: 1\n\n3. Total rebounds = 2 (UNC) + 1 (UMD) = 3\n\nHowever, there seems to be a discrepancy as the diagram shows only 15 rebounds for UMD Offense and 19 for UNC Offense, totaling 34 rebounds. Therefore, the correct answer is 34 rebounds in total by both teams.",
