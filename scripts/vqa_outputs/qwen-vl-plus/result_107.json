  "full_response": "<answer>20</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from \"Start\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" and then to \"_Exit\". \n\n1. Start: 37 patients arrive.\n2. Emergency: 12 patients are in emergency.\n3. Discharge-Alive: 20 patients are discharged alive.\n\nSince the link width between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is labeled with a count of 20, this indicates that 20 patients were discharged alive after being in emergency care. Therefore, the total number of patients who were discharged alive is 20.",
