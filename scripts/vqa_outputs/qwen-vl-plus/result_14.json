Start at the node labeled \"Arrival.\"\n2. Follow the link with a label of \"62\" leading to the node labeled \"Emergency.\"\n3. From \"Emergency,\" there is a direct link labeled \"38\" leading to the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\nThe numeric label next to the link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is 38, which indicates that 38 patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency. Therefore, the answer is 38.",
