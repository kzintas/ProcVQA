  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and their corresponding links.\n\n1. From the Start node, there are 22 sequences leading to the Made Shot node.\n2. From the Made Shot node, there is 1 link leading to the Rebound node with a label of 9.\n3. From the Missed Shot node, there is 1 link leading to the Rebound node with a label of 8.\n\nAdding these together: 22 (Made Shot) + 9 (Rebound from Made Shot) + 8 (Rebound from Missed Shot) = 39.\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the diagram as it shows only 31 rebounds instead of 39. Therefore, based on the information provided in the visualization, the correct answer is 31 rebounds.",
