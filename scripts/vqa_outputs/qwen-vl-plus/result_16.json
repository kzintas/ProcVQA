The width of the link between these two nodes represents the count of sequences following that path.\n\n1. Start at the ICU node.\n2. Follow the link labeled with the number 24, which connects the ICU node to the Floor node.\n3. The width of this link is 24, indicating that 24 patients went to the Floor after leaving the ICU.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 24 patients.",
