  "full_response": "<answer>38</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from \"Arrival\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" in the diagram. \n\n1. Start at the node labeled \"Arrival.\"\n2. Follow the link with a label of \"62\" leading to the node labeled \"Emergency.\"\n3. From \"Emergency,\" follow the link labeled \"38\" to the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\nThe link width between \"Arrival\" and \"Emergency\" is 62, indicating that 62 patients arrived at Emergency. The link width between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is 38, indicating that 38 of those patients were discharged alive.\n\nTherefore, the number of patients who got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency is 38.",
