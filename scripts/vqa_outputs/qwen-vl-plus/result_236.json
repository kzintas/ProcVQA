Start: The first node is \"Start,\" which indicates the beginning of a sequence.\n2. UMD Offense: The next node is \"UMD Offense,\" which represents the start of an offense by UMD.\n3. Made Free Throw: The final node is \"Made Free Throw,\" which shows that a free throw was made.\n\nThe link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\" has a label of \"10,\" indicating that there were 10 sequences where UMD Offense led to a made free throw. Therefore, UMD Offense made 10 free throws.",
