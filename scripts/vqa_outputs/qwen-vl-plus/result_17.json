  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Emergency, then to ICU, and finally to Floor. \n\n1. Start at _Start.\n2. Follow the link labeled \"Emergency\" with a count of 100.\n3. From Emergency, follow the link labeled \"ICU\" with a count of 62.\n4. From ICU, follow the link labeled \"Floor\" with a count of 24.\n\nThe total number of patients who went through this sequence is the product of the counts along these paths: 100 (Emergency) * 62 (ICU) * 24 (Floor) = 15840.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the number of patients discharged alive specifically after going to the Floor, we only consider the final step in the sequence that leads to Discharge-Alive. The count for this path is 24.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 24.",
