  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "21",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through UMD Offense and then to Missed Shot. According to the diagram:\n- The link from _Start to UMD Offense has a label of 69.\n- The link from UMD Offense to Missed Shot has a label of 14.\n\nSince each link represents a sequence of events, and the question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we add the labels of these two links together: 69 (from Start to UMD Offense) + 14 (from UMD Offense to Missed Shot) = 83.\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the provided answer as it states \"21\" instead of \"83\". Based on the diagram, the correct total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 83.",
