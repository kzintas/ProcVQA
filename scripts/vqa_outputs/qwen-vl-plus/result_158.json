  "reasoning": "To determine the total shots made by UMD offense, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through UMD Offense and then to _Exit. The diagram shows that there are 69 shots taken in the first step (from _Start to UNC Offense), followed by another 69 shots in the second step (from UNC Offense to UMD Offense). Therefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is the sum of these two steps.\n\nFirst step: 69 shots\nSecond step: 69 shots\n\nTotal shots = 69 + 69 = 138\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total shots made by UMD offense, which is represented by the link from UMD Offense to _Exit. According to the diagram, this link has a label of 35, indicating that 35 shots were made by UMD offense.",
