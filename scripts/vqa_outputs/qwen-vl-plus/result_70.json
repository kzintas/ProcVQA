  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from \"Start\" through \"Arrival,\" then to \"Emergency,\" and finally to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n1. Start: 100 patients\n2. Arrival: 100 patients (all arrive at Emergency)\n3. Emergency:\n   - Pathway to ICU: 62 patients\n   - Pathway to Discharge-Alive: 38 patients\n\nSince all patients who arrive at Emergency eventually go to either ICU or are discharged alive, we add the numbers together:\n\nTotal = Patients in ICU + Patients Discharged Alive\nTotal = 62 + 38\nTotal = 100\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 100.",
