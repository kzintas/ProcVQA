  "true_answer": "20",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Arrival to Floor and then to Discharge-Alive.\n\n1. Start at _Start with 12 patients.\n2. Move to Arrival with 12 patients.\n3. Continue to Floor with 23 patients.\n4. Finally, reach Discharge-Alive with 20 patients.\n\nAdding these numbers together: 12 (Start) + 12 (Arrival) + 23 (Floor) + 20 (Discharge-Alive) = 67 patients.\n\nHowever, since the question asks specifically about patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we should only consider the patients who reached Discharge-Alive after going to the Floor. Therefore, the correct answer is 20 patients.",
