  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, we need to follow the pathway from UNC Offense to UMD Offense in the diagram. \n\n1. Start at the node labeled \"UNC Offense.\"\n2. Follow the directed link labeled \"24\" leading to the node labeled \"Made Shot.\"\n3. From \"Made Shot,\" there is a link labeled \"22\" pointing to \"UMD Offense.\"\n\nThe link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" has a label of 24, and the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" has a label of 22. Therefore, the total number of transitions from UNC Offense to UMD Offense is the sum of these two labels: 24 + 22 = 46.\n\nHowever, it seems there might be an error in the provided answer as the correct calculation based on the diagram should be 34 (from the \"UMD Offense\" node). Thus, the correct answer is 34.",
