Count the number of times the label \"Rebound\" appears along the pathways.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The first rebound is from the \"Made Shot\" event.\n- The second rebound is from the \"Missed Shot\" event.\n- The third rebound is from the \"UMD Offense\" event.\n\nSo, there are a total of 3 rebounds in the match.",
