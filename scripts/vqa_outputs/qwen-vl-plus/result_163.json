Start at \"UNC Offense.\"\n2. Follow the link labeled \"Made Shot\" which leads to \"Turnover.\"\n3. Continue along the path until reaching \"UMD Offense.\"\n\nThe link from \"Made Shot\" to \"Turnover\" has a label of 4, indicating that there are 4 sequences where a made shot was followed by a turnover before reaching UMD Offense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 23 made shots after UNC Offense but before UMD offense.",
