  "true_answer": "42",
  "llm_answer": "29",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to count all instances where a \"Missed Shot\" event occurs. \n\n1. First, identify all nodes labeled \"Missed Shot.\"\n2. Count each instance of \"Missed Shot.\"\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- There are 7 instances of \"Missed Shot\" for UNC.\n- There are 6 instances of \"Missed Shot\" for UMD.\n\nAdding these together: \n7 (UNC) + 6 (UMD) = 13\n\nHowever, there is an additional instance of \"Missed Shot\" at the end of the sequence, which is not directly connected but can be inferred from the context of the game. This brings the total to:\n\n13 (initial count) + 1 (additional missed shot) = 14\n\nBut since the question asks for the total missed shots made by both teams, and considering the initial count was incorrect due to misinterpretation of the diagram's structure, let's correct this:\n\nThe correct approach should be to count only the direct instances of \"Missed Shot\" without adding any additional counts based on the diagram's structure. Therefore, the correct total is:\n\n7 (UNC) + 6 (UMD) = 13",
