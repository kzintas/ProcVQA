  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine how many shots were made directly after a Rebound, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Rebound\" node. The diagram shows that there are two pathways leading from \"Rebound\": one to \"Made Shot\" and another to \"Missed Shot\". \n\nThe link width between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" is labeled with the number 6, indicating that there are 6 sequences where a Made Shot follows a Rebound. Therefore, the answer is 6.",
