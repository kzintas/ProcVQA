Start -> UNC Offense (15)\n\nEach of these sequences shows a direct connection from \"Start\" to \"UNC Offense\" followed by \"Made Shot\". \n\nSumming up the counts for each sequence:\n- 7\n- 14\n- 15\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 28 sequences where only the UNC offense resulted in a shot being made.",
