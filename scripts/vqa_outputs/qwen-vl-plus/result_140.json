Start at the top node labeled \"Start.\"\n2. Move down to the first node labeled \"UNC Offense.\" There are 69 sequences leading from this node.\n3. Continue down to the next node labeled \"UMD Offense.\" There are 34 sequences leading from this node.\n4. From UMD Offense, there are two pathways: one leading to Rebound and another leading to Missed Shot.\n5. The link from UMD Offense to Missed Shot has a label of 14, indicating that 14 sequences lead directly from UMD Offense to Missed Shot.\n\nTherefore, the number of shots missed immediately after UMD Offense is 14.",
