  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Emergency and then to Discharge-Alive. \n\n1. Start at _Start.\n2. Follow the link labeled \"Arrival\" to Emergency, which has a count of 100.\n3. From Emergency, there are two paths: one leading to ICU with a count of 62 and another leading directly to Discharge-Alive with a count of 38.\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive, we add the counts from both pathways:\n- Pathway to ICU: 62\n- Direct path to Discharge-Alive: 38\n\nTotal = 62 + 38 = 100\n\nHowever, this calculation does not account for the patients who die in the ICU or on the floor. The diagram shows that 36 patients died in the ICU and 24 patients were discharged alive from the Floor. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is the sum of those who went directly to Discharge-Alive plus those who died in the ICU and then went to Discharge-Alive.\n\nTotal discharged alive = 38 (direct) + 36 (ICU deaths) + 24 (Floor discharge)\nTotal discharged alive = 98\n\nBut since the question specifically asks for the total number of patients discharged alive without considering deaths, the correct answer based on the direct pathway is 100.",
