Follow the link labeled \"Arrival\" with a count of 100.\n3. From Arrival, there is a link labeled \"ICU\" with a count of 36.\n\nSince the diagram shows that all patients who arrive at Emergency eventually go through the ICU, and out of those, 36 patients die, we can conclude that 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency.",
