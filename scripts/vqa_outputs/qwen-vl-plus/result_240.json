  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" in the diagram. \n\n1. Start with the first occurrence of \"Rebound\" at the top left corner of the diagram.\n2. Count each subsequent occurrence of \"Rebound\" moving down and across the diagram.\n\nThe nodes labeled \"Rebound\" are:\n- Top left: 1\n- Second row, second column: 5\n- Third row, third column: 8\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 5 + 8 = 14\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the provided answer as it states \"13\". Based on the diagram, the correct total is 14 rebounds made by both teams.",
