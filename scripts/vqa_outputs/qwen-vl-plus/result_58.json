  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through the Floor node and then to Discharge-Alive.\n\n1. Start at _Start with 100 patients.\n2. Move to Arrival with 100 patients.\n3. Proceed to Emergency with 21 patients.\n4. From Emergency, there are two pathways: one leading to Floor with 41 patients and another leading to Discharge-Alive with 38 patients.\n\nSince we are interested in patients who went to the Floor, we follow the path that leads to Floor:\n- From Emergency to Floor with 41 patients.\n- From Floor, there is a direct link to Discharge-Alive with 38 patients.\n\nAdding these numbers together gives us the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor:\n41 (Floor) + 38 (Discharge-Alive) = 79 patients.\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the provided diagram as it shows only 65 patients instead of 79. Based on the correct calculation, the answer should be 79 patients. Since the diagram does not reflect this, the correct answer based on the visualization is indeterminate.",
