  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of made shots by both teams, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" in the diagram. \n\n1. Start with the first sequence on the left:\n   - The first \"Made Shot\" node is at position 7.\n   - There are 7 sequences that end with a \"Made Shot\" node.\n\n2. Continue this process for each sequence:\n   - For the second sequence, there are 14 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the third sequence, there are 15 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the fourth sequence, there are 16 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the fifth sequence, there are 18 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the sixth sequence, there are 19 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the seventh sequence, there are 20 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the eighth sequence, there are 21 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the ninth sequence, there are 22 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the tenth sequence, there are 23 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the eleventh sequence, there are 24 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n   - For the twelfth sequence, there are 25 sequences ending with a \"Made Shot\".\n\nAdding these up: 7 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 = 250\n\nHowever, since each sequence represents a single made shot, and there are multiple sequences per team, we need to divide this total by 2 to get the total number of made shots by both teams.\n\nTotal made shots by both teams = 250 / 2 = 125",
