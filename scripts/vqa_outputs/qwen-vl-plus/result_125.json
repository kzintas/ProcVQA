  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Rebound\" node. The diagram shows that there are two pathways leading from the \"Rebound\" node: one to \"Made Shot\" and another to \"Missed Shot\". \n\nThe link width between \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\" is labeled with the number 15, indicating that 15 sequences followed this path. Therefore, 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
