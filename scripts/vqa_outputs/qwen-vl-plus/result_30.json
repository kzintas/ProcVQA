  "full_response": "<answer>38</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the total number of patients who were discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The width of the link between these two nodes represents the count of sequences following that path.\n\n1. Start at the \"Emergency\" node.\n2. Follow the link labeled \"62\" to the \"ICU\" node.\n3. From the \"ICU\" node, follow the link labeled \"38\" to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\nThe width of the link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is 38, which indicates that there are 38 sequences where patients were discharged alive after going through the emergency department.",
