  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Rebound\" node. The diagram shows that there are two pathways leading from the \"Rebound\" node: one labeled \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15 and another labeled \"_Exit\" with a count of 19. Since the question asks for shots made directly after a Rebound, we only consider the first pathway.\n\nThe label next to the link between the \"Rebound\" node and the \"Made Shot\" node is \"15,\" which indicates that 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
