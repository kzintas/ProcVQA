  "question": "How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "75",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, we need to follow the pathway from the ICU node to the Floor node. \n\n1. Start at the _Start node.\n2. Follow the link labeled 36 from the _Start node to the Emergency node.\n3. From the Emergency node, follow the link labeled 41 to the Floor node.\n4. The width of the link from the Floor node to the Die node is 24, and the width of the link from the Floor node to the Discharge-Alive node is also 24.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU is the sum of the widths of these two links: 24 (Floor \u2192 Die) + 24 (Floor \u2192 Discharge-Alive) = 48.\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the diagram as the correct calculation should be based on the direct connections from the ICU to the Floor nodes without considering the subsequent pathways. Let's correct this:\n\nFrom the ICU node, there are two direct paths:\n- To the Floor node with a width of 24.\n- To the Die node with a width of 36.\n\nSo, the correct answer is the sum of these two values: 24 (Floor) + 36 (Die) = 60.\n\nBut since the question asks for the number of patients who went to the Floor after the ICU, and considering the diagram's structure, the correct interpretation should be the path directly from ICU to Floor, which has a width of 24.\n\nThus, the final answer is 24 patients went to the Floor after the ICU.",
