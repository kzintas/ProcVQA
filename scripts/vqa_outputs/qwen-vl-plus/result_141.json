  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the number of shots made directly after a Rebound, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Rebound\" node. The diagram shows that there are two pathways leading from the \"Rebound\" node: one labeled \"Made Shot\" and another labeled \"_Exit\". \n\nThe link connecting \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" has a label of 15, indicating that 15 sequences resulted in a Made Shot directly after a Rebound. Therefore, the answer is 15.",
