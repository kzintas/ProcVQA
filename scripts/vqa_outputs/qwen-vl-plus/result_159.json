The link width between these nodes represents the count of sequences following that path.\n\n1. Start node has a label of 69.\n2. From Start to UNC Offense, there are 69 sequences.\n3. From UNC Offense to UMD Offense, there are 34 sequences.\n4. From UMD Offense to _Exit, there are 35 sequences.\n\nThe total number of sequences is the sum of all these counts: 69 (Start to UNC) + 34 (UNC to UMD) + 35 (UMD to Exit) = 138 sequences.\n\nSince each sequence represents one foul, the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense is 138.",
