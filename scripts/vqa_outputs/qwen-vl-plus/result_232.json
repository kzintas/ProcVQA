Start at \"UNC Offense\".\n2. Follow the link to \"Rebound\".\n3. Continue to \"Foul\".\n4. Next, go to \"Made Free Throw\".\n5. Finally, reach \"UMD Offense\".\n\nAlong this path, the nodes labeled \"Missed Shot\" are:\n- Missed Shot (after Rebound)\n- Missed Shot (after Foul)\n\nBoth of these missed shots occur after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense. Therefore, the total number of missed shots in this sequence is 19.",
