Start at the node labeled \"Arrival\", which has a count of 100.\n2. From \"Arrival\", there are two pathways leading to \"Emergency\": one with a count of 62 and another with a count of 38.\n3. We are interested in the pathway that leads to \"Die\", so we follow the link from \"Emergency\" to \"Die\" with a count of 36.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36.",
