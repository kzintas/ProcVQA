  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of shots made by UMD offense, we need to follow the pathway from Start to Made Shot. \n\n1. Start is connected to UNC Offense with 69 sequences.\n2. UNC Offense is connected to UMD Offense with 34 sequences.\n3. UMD Offense has two pathways leading to Missed Shot and Foul.\n\nFollowing the pathway to Made Shot:\n- From UMD Offense, there are 10 sequences leading to Missed Shot.\n- From UMD Offense, there are 8 sequences leading to Foul.\n- From Missed Shot, there are 6 sequences leading to Made Free Throw.\n- From Foul, there are 4 sequences leading to Turnover.\n\nAdding these sequences together: \n69 (Start) + 34 (UMD Offense) + 10 (Missed Shot) + 8 (Foul) + 6 (Made Free Throw) + 4 (Turnover) = 145\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total number of shots made by UMD offense, which includes both successful and unsuccessful attempts. Since the diagram only shows successful attempts (Made Shot), we should consider the direct path from Start to Made Shot.\n\nTherefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is 14.",
