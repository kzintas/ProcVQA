Start at the Floor node.\n2. Follow the link labeled with the number 23, which connects the Floor node to the ICU node.\n\nSince there is a single link from the Floor node to the ICU node with a label of 23, it indicates that 23 patients went to the ICU after leaving the Floor. Therefore, the answer is 23.",
