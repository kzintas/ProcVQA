Made Free Throw: The final node is \"Made Free Throw,\" which shows that a free throw was made.\n\nThe link between \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\" has a label of \"10,\" indicating that there were 10 sequences where UMD Offense led to a made free throw. Therefore, UMD Offense made 10 free throws.",
