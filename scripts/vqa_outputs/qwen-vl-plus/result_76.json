  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Arrival to Floor and then to Discharge-Alive.\n\n1. Start at _Start.\n2. Follow the link labeled 24 to Arrival.\n3. Continue along the link labeled 23 to Floor.\n4. Finally, take the link labeled 20 to Discharge-Alive.\n\nThe numeric labels next to each link indicate the exact count of sequences following that path. Therefore, the total number of patients who went through these steps is 24 (Arrival) + 23 (Floor) + 20 (Discharge-Alive) = 67 patients.\n\nHowever, since the question asks specifically about patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we only consider the sequence leading to Discharge-Alive after Floor. Thus, the correct answer is 23 patients.",
