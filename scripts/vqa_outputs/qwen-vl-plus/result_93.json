  "full_response": "<answer>20</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Start\" node labeled \"Arrival\" to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. \n\n1. Start at the \"Start\" node with a label of \"Arrival\" and a count of 37.\n2. Follow the link to the \"Emergency\" node with a label of \"Emergency\" and a count of 24.\n3. Continue to the \"ICU\" node with a label of \"ICU\" and a count of 23.\n4. Proceed to the \"Floor\" node with a label of \"Floor\" and a count of 23.\n5. Move to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node with a label of \"Discharge-Alive\" and a count of 20.\n\nThe total number of patients who were discharged alive is the sum of all counts along this pathway: 37 (Arrival) + 24 (Emergency) + 23 (ICU) + 23 (Floor) + 20 (Discharge-Alive) = 126.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive, and there are no other pathways leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, the correct answer is the count at the \"Discharge-Alive\" node, which is 20.",
