  "full_response": "<answer>23</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the total number of patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from _Start through Arrival to Floor and then to Discharge-Alive. \n\n1. Start at the top with _Start.\n2. Follow the orange link labeled 24 to Arrival.\n3. Continue down the green link labeled 23 to Floor.\n4. Finally, take the pink link labeled 20 to Discharge-Alive.\n\nThe numeric labels next to each link indicate the exact count of sequences following that path. By multiplying these numbers together (24 * 23 * 20), we get the total number of patients who went through this sequence: 24 * 23 * 20 = 11,520.\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor is 23.",
