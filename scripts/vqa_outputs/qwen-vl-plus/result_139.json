  "reasoning": "To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to look at the pathways from UMD Offense. There are two paths from UMD Offense: one leading to Rebound and another leading to Missed Shot.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- The path from UMD Offense to Rebound has 34 sequences.\n- The path from UMD Offense to Missed Shot has 14 sequences.\n\nSince there are a total of 69 sequences starting from UMD Offense (as indicated by the label next to the node), we can calculate the number of sequences that did not transition to a Rebound by subtracting the number of sequences that did transition to a Rebound from the total sequences:\n\nTotal sequences from UMD Offense = 69\nSequences transitioning to Rebound = 34\n\nSequences not transitioning to Rebound = Total sequences from UMD Offense - Sequences transitioning to Rebound\n= 69 - 34\n= 35\n\nHowever, this calculation gives us the number of sequences that transitioned to Missed Shot instead of those that did not transition to Rebound. To find the correct answer, we should consider the direct question asked: \"How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?\"\n\nThe correct interpretation is that we are looking for the number of sequences that directly led to _Exit without going through Rebound. From the diagram, the path from UMD Offense to _Exit has 21 sequences.\n\nTherefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is 21.",
