  "full_response": "<answer>26</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to identify all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" and count them. We also need to ensure that these nodes are connected exclusively through links originating from nodes labeled \"UNC Offense.\"\n\n1. Identify nodes labeled \"Made Shot\": These are nodes with a purple label.\n2. Check for links connecting these nodes: Look for links leading directly from nodes labeled \"UNC Offense.\"\n3. Count the number of such links.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- There are 9 nodes labeled \"Made Shot.\"\n- All 9 of these nodes have links leading directly from nodes labeled \"UNC Offense.\"\n\nTherefore, the total number of shots made by only the UNC offense is 26.",
