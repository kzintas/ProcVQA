  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients who were discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from the \"Emergency\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. According to the diagram:\n1. From the \"Emergency\" node, there are 62 pathways leading to the \"ICU\" node.\n2. From the \"ICU\" node, there are 36 pathways leading to the \"Die\" node and 26 pathways leading to the \"_Exit\" node.\n3. From the \"_Exit\" node, there is 1 pathway leading to the \"_Exit\" node.\n\nSince all pathways from the \"Emergency\" node lead directly to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node without any branching, the total number of patients who were discharged alive is simply the count at the \"Emergency\" node, which is 100.",
