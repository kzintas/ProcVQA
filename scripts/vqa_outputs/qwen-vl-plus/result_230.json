Start with the first pathway: \n   - The first event is \"Start\" with 19 sequences.\n   - Follow the link labeled \"Made Shot\" which has a count of 28 sequences.\n\nSince there are no other events between \"Start\" and \"Made Shot\" for this pathway, it indicates that all 19 sequences of the UNC offense resulted in a made shot. Therefore, the total number of shots made by only the UNC offense is 28.",
