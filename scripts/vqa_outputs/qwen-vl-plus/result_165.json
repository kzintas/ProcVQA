  "true_answer": "53",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" along the pathways from the start node to the end nodes. \n\n1. Start at the topmost node labeled \"Start.\"\n2. Follow the pathway down to the first node labeled \"Rebound.\" This is the first rebound.\n3. Continue following the pathway and count each subsequent \"Rebound\" node encountered.\n\nThe pathway from the start node to the end nodes includes:\n- The first rebound (node 9)\n- The second rebound (node 4)\n\nAdding these together, we get a total of 9 + 4 = 13 rebounds.\n\nHowever, there are additional rebounds shown in the diagram that are not directly connected to the main pathway from start to end. These include:\n- Rebound from UMD Offense to Missed Shot (node 7)\n- Rebound from UMD Offense to Turnover (node 6)\n\nAdding these additional rebounds, we have a total of 13 + 7 + 6 = 26 rebounds.\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of rebounds in the match, and the diagram shows only 23 rebounds explicitly connected to the main pathway, the answer is 23.",
