Start at the \"Arrival\" node.\n2. Follow the link labeled \"62\" leading to the \"Emergency\" node.\n3. From the \"Emergency\" node, follow the link labeled \"38\" leading to the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n\nThe numeric label next to the link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive\" is 38, which indicates that 38 patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
