  "full_response": "<answer>15</answer>\n<reasoning>\nTo determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to count all the nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and their corresponding link labels.\n\n1. Start at the node labeled \"Start.\"\n2. Follow the path to the first \"Rebound\" node.\n3. The link label next to this \"Rebound\" node is 22.\n4. Continue following the path from the \"Rebound\" node to the next event.\n5. The next event is \"Made Shot,\" which has a link label of 22.\n6. From the \"Made Shot\" node, follow the path to the next \"Rebound\" node.\n7. The link label next to this \"Rebound\" node is 23.\n8. Finally, follow the path from the last \"Rebound\" node to the \"Exit\" node.\n9. The link label next to this \"Exit\" node is 15.\n\nAdding up all the link labels for the \"Rebound\" nodes: 22 + 22 + 23 + 15 = 82.\n\nHowever, it seems there might be an error in the diagram as the total number of rebounds should not exceed the number of events (which is 69). Let's re-examine the diagram carefully:\n\n- There are 69 events in total.\n- The sum of the link labels for the \"Rebound\" nodes is 82, which exceeds the total number of events.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, it appears that the diagram may have an error or misinterpretation. Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined based on the information provided in the visualization.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>indeterminate</answer>.",
