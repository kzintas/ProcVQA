Start at the \"Arrival\" node with a label of 37.\n2. Follow the link labeled 37 from \"Arrival\" to \"Emergency\".\n3. Continue along the path to \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\".\n\nThe label next to the link between \"Emergency\" and \"Discharge-Alive _Exit\" is 37, indicating that there are 37 sequences where patients get discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency.",
