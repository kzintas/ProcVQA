  "full_response": "<answer>15</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathway from \"Start\" to \"Exit\" for UMD Offense. \n\n1. Start: UMD Offense (33 sequences)\n2. Rebound: 19 sequences\n3. Missed Shot: 18 sequences\n4. Made Shot: 7 sequences\n\nThe link labeled \"Made Shot\" has a numeric label of 7, indicating that there were 7 sequences where UMD Offense made a shot after rebounding and missing a shot. Since this is the final step in the sequence leading to \"Exit,\" it represents the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>15</answer>.",
