  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "<answer>8</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathway from \"Start\" to \"Made Free Throw\" for UMD Offense. \n\n1. Start: UMD Offense (13)\n2. Rebound: 7\n3. Missed Shot: 6\n4. Rebound: 11\n5. Made Shot: 7\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that there are two pathways leading from \"Start\" to \"Made Free Throw\" for UMD Offense:\n- One path goes through \"Rebound\" and \"Missed Shot\", then directly to \"Made Free Throw\".\n- The other path goes through \"Rebound\" and \"Made Shot\", then directly to \"Made Free Throw\".\n\nBoth paths show a count of 8 for \"Made Free Throw\". Therefore, UMD Offense made a total of 8 free throws.",
