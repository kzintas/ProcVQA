  "full_response": "<answer>20</answer>\n\n## Reasoning\nTo determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathway from \"Start\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" and then to \"_Exit\". \n\n1. Start: 37 patients\n2. Emergency: 37 patients (all start events are connected to emergency)\n3. ICU: 12 patients (some start events lead to ICU)\n4. Discharge-Alive: 20 patients (some ICU patients proceed to discharge alive)\n\nThe total number of patients who were discharged alive is the sum of those who went through the ICU and ended up being discharged alive. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:\n\nTotal discharged alive = Number of patients in ICU who proceeded to discharge alive\n\nSince all patients in the ICU eventually proceed to discharge alive, the total number of patients discharged alive is equal to the number of patients who entered the ICU.\n\nNumber of patients in ICU = 12\n\nTherefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 12.",
