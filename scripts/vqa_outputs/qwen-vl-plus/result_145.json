  "reasoning": "To determine the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathway from Start through UMD Offense and then to Rebound. The diagram shows that there is a link from Start to UMD Offense with a label of 69, indicating that 69 sequences start with UMD Offense. From UMD Offense, there are two pathways: one leading to Rebound with a label of 34, and another leading to Exit with a label of 35. Since we are interested in the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense, we focus on the link labeled 34. Therefore, the number of Rebounds made by UMD Offense is 34.",
