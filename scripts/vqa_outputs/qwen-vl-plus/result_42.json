  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "72",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to follow the pathways from the \"Start\" node to the \"Discharge-Alive\" and \"Exit\" nodes. \n\n1. From the \"Start\" node, there are 100 patients who arrive.\n2. Out of these, 38 patients go directly to \"Discharge-Alive\" and exit without further treatment.\n3. The remaining 62 patients (100 - 38) proceed to the \"Emergency\" node.\n4. From \"Emergency,\" 21 patients go to \"Floor.\"\n5. Out of the 21 patients on \"Floor,\" 24 patients go to \"Discharge-Alive\" and exit.\n6. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38 (directly from \"Start\") + 24 (from \"Floor\"), which equals 62.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive, we should consider the direct pathway from \"Start\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" as well. Thus, the correct answer is 72 (38 from the direct path + 36 from the indirect path).",
