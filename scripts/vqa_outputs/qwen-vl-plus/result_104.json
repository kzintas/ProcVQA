  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\n1. Start at the node labeled \"Floor.\"\n2. Follow the link with a label of 23, which leads to the node labeled \"ICU.\"\n3. From \"ICU,\" follow the link with a label of 24, leading to the node labeled \"Floor.\"\n4. Finally, follow the link with a label of 20, leading to the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive.\"\n\nThe total number of patients who went through this sequence is the sum of the labels along the path: 23 (Floor) + 24 (ICU) + 20 (Discharge-Alive) = 67.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, and there are no other pathways leading directly from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive,\" the correct answer is the label on the direct link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive,\" which is 20.",
