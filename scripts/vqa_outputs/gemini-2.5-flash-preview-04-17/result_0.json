  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The user wants to find the number of patients who died after arriving at the 'Emergency' event.\n1. I identified the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2. I traced the outgoing paths from 'Emergency'. There are two paths: one to 'ICU' (62 sequences) and one to 'Discharge-Alive' (38 sequences).\n3. I need to find the paths that lead to the 'Die' node.\n4. Following the path from 'Emergency' through 'ICU', I see an outgoing link from 'ICU' to 'Die' with a count of 36. This indicates that 36 sequences that arrived at 'ICU' subsequently went to 'Die'.\n5. Since these sequences came from 'Emergency' via 'ICU', these 36 patients arrived at 'Emergency' and then died.\n6. The other path from 'Emergency' goes to 'Discharge-Alive' and does not involve death.\n7. Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the number of sequences following the Emergency -> ICU -> Die path, which is 36.",
