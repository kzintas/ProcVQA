Examine the first pathway from the left:\n    -   _Start -> Arrival (12)\n    -   Arrival -> Emergency (12)\n    -   Emergency -> ICU (12)\n    -   ICU -> Die (12)\n    -   Die -> _Exit (12)\n    This pathway includes Emergency followed by Die, accounting for 12 patients.\n\n2.  Examine the second pathway:\n    -   _Start -> Arrival (37)\n    -   Arrival -> Emergency (37)\n    -   Emergency -> Discharge-Alive (37)\n    -   Discharge-Alive -> _Exit (37)\n    This pathway goes from Emergency to Discharge-Alive, not Die.\n\n3.  Examine the third pathway:\n    -   _Start -> Arrival (24)\n    -   Arrival -> Emergency (24)\n    -   Emergency -> ICU (23)\n    -   ICU -> Floor (23)\n    -   Floor -> Discharge-Alive (20) and Floor -> _Exit (implied, remaining 3 sequences? No, the _Exit from Floor is not explicitly shown, the _Exit from Discharge-Alive is 24, which implies the 20 from Discharge-Alive plus 4 from another path from Floor. However, there is no link from Floor to _Exit with a count of 4. Let's re-examine the pathways).\n\nLet's look at all paths leading to a 'Die' node and see if they originate from 'Emergency'.\n\n-   There is one 'Die' node in the first column, reached from ICU. The sequence leading to this ICU is Emergency -> ICU (12). So, Emergency -> ICU -> Die accounts for 12 deaths after Emergency.\n-   There is one 'Die' node in the fourth column, reached from ICU. The sequence leading to this ICU is Floor -> ICU (24). The sequence leading to this Floor is Emergency -> Floor (27). So, Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die accounts for 18 deaths (the link from ICU to Die has label 18).\n\nLet's verify the counts.\nColumn 1: Arrival (12) -> Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die (12) -> _Exit (12). This path contributes 12 deaths after Emergency.\nColumn 2: Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive (37) -> _Exit (37). No deaths here.\nColumn 3: Arrival (24) -> Emergency (24) -> ICU (23) -> Floor (23) -> Discharge-Alive (20) -> _Exit (24). No deaths shown in this branch. (Note: There is a discrepancy here: 23 go into Floor, but only 20 go to Discharge-Alive and 24 exit here in total. This might imply some sequences exit directly from Floor, but it's not explicitly shown. However, no path to Die from this branch is shown).\nColumn 4: Arrival (27) -> Emergency (27) -> Floor (27) -> ICU (24) -> Die (18) -> _Exit (27). This path goes from Emergency to Floor to ICU to Die, accounting for 18 deaths after Emergency. The remaining sequences from ICU (24) go to _Exit (27 total exit from this column, 18 died, 27 - 18 = 9 must exit from ICU directly or via Floor/another path? The link from ICU (24) goes to Die (18) and _Exit (27 is the total exit count for the column, not from ICU directly). The diagram shows two links from ICU (24): one to Die (18) and one implying the rest go elsewhere or exit. The _Exit node in this column has a label of 27, which is the total starting number. The patients who died are 18. The difference 27 - 18 = 9 are the ones who exit alive. The path is Emergency (27) -> Floor (27) -> ICU (24). From ICU (24), 18 go to Die and 9 must go to Discharge-Alive (not shown as a separate node/link from ICU in this column, but implied to exit alive). The Die node shows 18 patients. This 18 came from the ICU node in the same column. The ICU node received 24 patients from the Floor node. The Floor node received 27 from the Emergency node. So the path is Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die. The number following this path to Die is 18.\n\nSo, the sequences from Emergency that end in Die are:\n1. Emergency -> ICU -> Die (12 sequences)\n2. Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die (18 sequences)\n\nTotal patients who died after arriving at Emergency = Sum of sequences in these paths = 12 + 18 = 30.\n\nThe relevant elements are the nodes 'Emergency', 'ICU', 'Floor', 'Die', and the links connecting them with their numeric labels.\nPath 1: Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die (12)\nPath 2: Emergency (27) -> Floor (27) -> ICU (24) -> Die (18)\nThe number of patients who died via Path 1 is 12.\nThe number of patients who died via Path 2 is 18.\nTotal deaths after Emergency = 12 + 18 = 30.<reasoning>The question asks for the total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency. I need to find all pathways that start from 'Emergency' and end with 'Die'.\n\n1.  Locate all 'Emergency' nodes. There are four such nodes, each representing the start of a patient flow after arriving.\n2.  Trace the pathways originating from these 'Emergency' nodes downwards, looking for paths that eventually lead to a 'Die' node.\n3.  Pathway 1 (leftmost column): Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die (12). This path shows 12 patients went from Emergency to ICU and then died.\n4.  Pathway 2 (second column): Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive (37). No deaths in this pathway.\n5.  Pathway 3 (third column): Emergency (24) -> ICU (23) -> Floor (23) -> Discharge-Alive (20). No deaths shown in this pathway.\n6.  Pathway 4 (fourth column): Emergency (27) -> Floor (27) -> ICU (24) -> Die (18). This path shows 18 patients went from Emergency to Floor, then to ICU, and then died.\n\nThe total number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the sum of patients in the pathways identified in steps 3 and 6 that lead to 'Die'.\nTotal deaths = (Number of patients in Pathway 1 ending in Die) + (Number of patients in Pathway 4 ending in Die)\nTotal deaths = 12 + 18 = 30.\n\nThe diagram explicitly shows the number of sequences flowing through each link and node. The links leading into the 'Die' nodes indicate the number of sequences that reached that point. In the first column, 12 sequences go from ICU to Die. In the fourth column, 18 sequences go from ICU to Die. Both of these ICU nodes are reached from an Emergency node.\nFirst column path to Die: Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die (12). Contributes 12 deaths.\nFourth column path to Die: Emergency (27) -> Floor (27) -> ICU (24) -> Die (18). Contributes 18 deaths.\nTotal = 12 + 18 = 30.<answer>30</answer>",
