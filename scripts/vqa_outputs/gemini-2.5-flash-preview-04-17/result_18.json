  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I need to find the number of patients who started at 'Emergency' and ended up at the 'Die' node.\n2.  I will trace the paths originating from the 'Emergency' node.\n3.  From 'Emergency', there are two outgoing paths: one to 'ICU' (count 62) and one to 'Discharge-Alive' (count 38).\n4.  The 'Die' node is only reachable from the 'ICU' node.\n5.  The link from 'ICU' to 'Die' has a count of 36.\n6.  This means 36 sequences went from 'ICU' to 'Die'.\n7.  Since the path to 'ICU' originates from 'Emergency' (62 sequences), these 36 sequences that reached 'Die' must have passed through 'Emergency' and then 'ICU'.\n8.  Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is 36, as indicated by the flow from 'ICU' to 'Die'.",
