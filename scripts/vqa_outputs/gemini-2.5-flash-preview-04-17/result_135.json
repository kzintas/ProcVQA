  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. I located the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2. I examined all outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node to identify possible subsequent events.\n3. The outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" lead to \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n4. The labels on these links and the subsequent nodes do not mention \"Fouls\".\n5. The diagram only shows sequences related to Rebounds, Made Shots, Missed Shots, and Exits after UMD Offense.\n6. Since there is no node or link indicating \"Fouls\" originating from \"UMD Offense\", the number of fouls is not present in the visualization.\n7. Therefore, the question about the number of fouls made by UMD Offense cannot be answered based on the information provided in the diagram.",
