  "question": "How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "I need to identify all nodes in the diagram labeled 'Rebound' and sum the numeric values associated with them.\n1. Locate the first node labeled 'Rebound'. It is in the second vertical sequence of events. The number associated with this node is 19.\n2. Locate the second node labeled 'Rebound'. It is in the third vertical sequence of events, below the 'UMD Offense' node. The number associated with this node is 15.\n3. Sum the counts from all 'Rebound' nodes found: 19 + 15 = 34.\n4. The diagram shows two distinct 'Rebound' nodes with counts 19 and 15. The question asks for the total number of rebounds by both teams, and these nodes represent rebounds occurring within the observed sequences. Summing the counts of these 'Rebound' nodes gives the total number of rebounds shown.",
