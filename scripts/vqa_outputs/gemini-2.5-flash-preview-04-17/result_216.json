  "full_response": "<reason>\nThe user is asking for the total number of shots made by the UNC offense as shown in the node-link diagram. I need to identify all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" or \"Made Free Throw\" that occur within a sequence originating from \"_Start\" and explicitly linked to \"UNC Offense\" events.\n\n1.  Examine each column representing different starting points/sequences.\n2.  Column 1: Starts with UNC Offense (7). The sequence includes Missed Shot, UMD Offense, Rebound, Missed Shot, and \\_Exit. There is no \"Made Shot\" or \"Made Free Throw\" by UNC in this sequence.\n3.  Column 2: Starts with UNC Offense (14). The sequence includes Rebound, Missed Shot, UMD Offense, Rebound, and Made Shot (7). The \"Made Shot\" node follows \"UMD Offense\". This shot was made by the UMD offense, not UNC.\n4.  Column 3: Starts with UNC Offense (15). The sequence includes Foul (15), Made Free Throw (13), Made Free Throw (8), UMD Offense (8), and \\_Exit (15). The \"Made Free Throw\" nodes (13 and 8) follow a \"Foul\" which occurred during a \"UNC Offense\" sequence. Free throws are shots made by the offense. So, 13 sequences resulted in a Made Free Throw, and 8 of those sequences had *another* Made Free Throw. The total number of made free throws within these paths is 13 + 8 = 21. These were made by the UNC offense.\n5.  Column 4: Starts with UNC Offense (5). The sequence includes Jump Ball and UMD Offense (5), then Made Shot (4), and \\_Exit (5). The \"Made Shot\" node follows \"UMD Offense\". This shot was made by the UMD offense, not UNC.\n6.  Column 5: Starts with UNC Offense (28). The sequence includes Rebound (18), Made Shot (16). This \"Made Shot\" node follows \"Rebound\" which is part of the UNC Offense sequence starting with 28. This represents 16 made shots by the UNC offense. The path also branches to UMD Offense (12) and Missed Shot (7), neither of which are made shots by UNC.\n7.  Sum the counts of made shots/free throws explicitly linked to UNC Offense sequences:\n    *   From Column 3: 21 (Made Free Throws)\n    *   From Column 5: 16 (Made Shots)\n    *   Total = 21 + 16 = 37.\n\nAll identified made shots/free throws (21 and 16) are located downstream from a UNC Offense node within their respective main pathways, and upstream of any potential change of possession to UMD Offense within that specific flow (except where the made shot/free throw *causes* the change of possession or end of sequence). The phrasing \"made by only the UNC offense\" reinforces that I should only count those resulting from UNC possessions, which these do.\n</reason>\n<answer>37</answer>",
