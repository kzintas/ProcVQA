  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The diagram shows that 100 patients start and arrive at Emergency.\nFrom Emergency, 62 patients go to ICU and 38 patients go to Discharge-Alive.\nFrom ICU, 36 patients go to Die, and 26 patients go to _Exit.\nFrom Die, 36 patients go to _Exit.\nFrom Discharge-Alive, 38 patients go to _Exit.\n\nThe question asks how many patients died after arriving at Emergency.\nPatients arriving at Emergency are represented by the inflow into the 'Emergency' node, which is 100 (from 'Arrival').\nPatients who died are represented by the transition to the 'Die' node.\nThe only path shown that includes both 'Emergency' and 'Die' is Emergency -> ICU -> Die.\nThe number of patients who followed the transition from ICU to Die is 36.\nSince all patients arriving at ICU came from Emergency, these 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency and going through ICU.",
  "full_response": "1.  Identify the relevant nodes and links: The nodes are '_Start', 'Arrival', 'Emergency', 'ICU', 'Die', 'Discharge-Alive', and '_Exit'. The links show transitions between these nodes with numerical labels indicating the number of sequences.\n2.  Trace the paths from the 'Emergency' node. There are two paths: one leading to 'ICU' (62 patients) and one leading to 'Discharge-Alive' (38 patients).\n3.  Examine the path segment leading to 'Die'. The 'Die' node is reached from the 'ICU' node. The link from 'ICU' to 'Die' has a count of 36.\n4.  This means 36 patients transitioned from 'ICU' to 'Die'. Since all patients entering 'ICU' originated from 'Emergency' (62 patients), these 36 patients who died were among those who arrived at Emergency and then went to ICU.\n5.  The question asks for the number of patients who died *after* arriving at Emergency. The path leading to death shown in the diagram is Emergency -> ICU -> Die. The number of patients following this specific path segment from ICU to Die is 36. There are no other paths shown leading to 'Die' from 'Emergency' or any other node originating from 'Emergency'.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe diagram shows that 100 patients start and arrive at Emergency.\nFrom Emergency, 62 patients go to ICU and 38 patients go to Discharge-Alive.\nFrom ICU, 36 patients go to Die, and 26 patients go to _Exit.\nFrom Die, 36 patients go to _Exit.\nFrom Discharge-Alive, 38 patients go to _Exit.\n\nThe question asks how many patients died after arriving at Emergency.\nPatients arriving at Emergency are represented by the inflow into the 'Emergency' node, which is 100 (from 'Arrival').\nPatients who died are represented by the transition to the 'Die' node.\nThe only path shown that includes both 'Emergency' and 'Die' is Emergency -> ICU -> Die.\nThe number of patients who followed the transition from ICU to Die is 36.\nSince all patients arriving at ICU came from Emergency, these 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency and going through ICU.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>36</answer>",
