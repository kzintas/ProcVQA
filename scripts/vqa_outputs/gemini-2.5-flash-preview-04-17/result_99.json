Examine the first column: The path is '_Start' -> 'Arrival' -> 'Emergency' -> 'ICU' -> 'Die' -> '_Exit'. The number of sequences following the 'ICU' -> 'Die' link is 12.\n4.  Examine the second column: The path from 'Emergency' leads to 'Discharge-Alive'. There is no 'Die' node in this column.\n5.  Examine the third column: The path from 'Emergency' leads to 'ICU' -> 'Floor' -> 'Discharge-Alive' or '_Exit'. There is no 'Die' node in this column.\n6.

Identify all counts associated with links leading directly to the 'Die' node from any node that is reachable *after* 'Emergency'.
