  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The user is asking for the total number of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur in sequences that contain \"UNC Offense\" earlier and \"UMD Offense\" later. I need to identify all paths in the diagram that start with \"UNC Offense\", go through a \"Missed Shot\" node, and then reach a \"UMD Offense\" node. The numeric labels on the links indicate the number of sequences following that specific transition.\n\n1.  Examine paths starting from \"UNC Offense\" nodes.\n2.  Trace these paths to find \"Missed Shot\" nodes.\n3.  From those \"Missed Shot\" nodes, trace forward to see if they lead to \"UMD Offense\" nodes.\n4.  Sum the number of sequences that follow such paths containing a \"Missed Shot\" between \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n\nLet's trace the relevant paths:\n\n*   **Column 2:** The sequence starts with _Start (14) -> UNC Offense (14). From UNC Offense (14), 14 sequences go to Rebound (14). From Rebound (14), 14 sequences go to Missed Shot (14). This Missed Shot (14) is after the UNC Offense. From Missed Shot (14), 13 sequences go to Rebound (13), and 1 goes to \\_Exit (1). From Rebound (13), 13 sequences go to UMD Offense (13).\n    So, there is a path segment: UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> Rebound -> UMD Offense. This path segment is followed by 13 sequences (indicated by the link counts from Missed Shot to Rebound, and Rebound to UMD Offense). The Missed Shot in these 13 sequences occurs after the UNC Offense and before the UMD Offense. Thus, this contributes 13 missed shots to the total.\n\n*   **Column 5:** The sequence starts with _Start (9) -> UNC Offense (9). From UNC Offense (9), 9 sequences go to Missed Shot (9). This Missed Shot (9) is after the UNC Offense. From Missed Shot (9), 8 sequences go to UMD Offense (8), and 1 goes to Rebound (1). The path going directly to UMD Offense is UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense. This path segment is followed by 8 sequences (indicated by the link count from Missed Shot to UMD Offense). The Missed Shot in these 8 sequences occurs after the UNC Offense and before the UMD Offense. Thus, this contributes 8 missed shots to the total. The path going to Rebound (1) leads to Missed Shot (1) which goes to _Exit (1). This sequence does not reach UMD Offense after the Missed Shot(s).\n\n*   **Other Columns:**\n    *   Column 1: UNC Offense (2) -> Jump Ball (1) / Made Shot (2). No Missed Shot after UNC Offense.\n    *   Column 3: UNC Offense (12) -> Rebound (5) / Foul (9). No Missed Shot immediately after, and tracing forward from Rebound or Foul does not show paths leading to UMD Offense that pass through a Missed Shot based on the diagram structure.\n    *   Column 4: UNC Offense (14) -> Steal (6). From Steal (6), UMD Offense (10) is reached. No Missed Shot between.\n    *   Column 6: UNC Offense (18) -> Made Shot (17). From Made Shot (17), UMD Offense (15) is reached. No Missed Shot between.\n\nBased on the explicit paths shown in the diagram where a Missed Shot occurs in a sequence segment starting with UNC Offense and ending with UMD Offense, the relevant sequences are the 13 from Column 2 and the 8 from Column 5.\n\nTotal number of missed shots = 13 (from Col 2 path) + 8 (from Col 5 path) = 21. Each sequence counted represents one occurrence of a Missed Shot event that satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is the sum of the counts on the paths identified: 13 + 8 = 21.",
