  "question": "How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "40",
  "llm_answer": "40",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "I have examined the node-link diagram to identify all instances of the event \"Rebound\".\nI located the following nodes labeled \"Rebound\" and their corresponding counts:\n- In the second column, after \"UNC Offense\", there is a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 14.\n- In the second column, after \"UNC Offense\" and \"Missed Shot\", there is a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 13.\n- In the third column, after \"UNC Offense\", there is a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 5.\n- In the fifth column, after \"UNC Offense\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\", there is a \"Rebound\" node with a count of 8.\n\nTo find the total number of rebounds, I sum these counts: 14 + 13 + 5 + 8 = 40.\nThe question asks for the total rebounds by both teams. The diagram shows rebound events occurring in different sequence flows, and the label is simply \"Rebound\", without specifying which team made it. However, since the diagram tracks game events, all rebound events are included. Therefore, the sum of the counts associated with the \"Rebound\" nodes represents the total number of rebounds recorded in the sequences shown in the diagram, regardless of which team secured them. I am assuming these represent all rebounds within the visualized sequences.",
