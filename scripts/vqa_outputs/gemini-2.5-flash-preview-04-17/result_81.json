In the third pathway from the left, there is a link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' with the value 23.\n5. There are no other direct links from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' shown in the diagram.\n6. To find the total number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency, I sum the values of these links: 12 + 23.\n7. The sum is 35.",
