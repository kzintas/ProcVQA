  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency.\n1.  Identify the \"Emergency\" node.\n2.  Identify the \"Die\" node.\n3.  Trace all possible paths from \"Emergency\" that lead to the \"Die\" node.\n4.  The paths originating from \"Emergency\" are:\n    *   Emergency -> Floor (21 sequences)\n    *   Emergency -> Discharge-Alive (38 sequences)\n    *   Emergency -> ICU (41 sequences)\n5.  Follow the paths from these nodes:\n    *   Emergency -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit (38 sequences): This path does not lead to \"Die\".\n    *   Emergency -> Floor (21 sequences): From Floor, the path is Floor -> ICU (21 sequences). So, Emergency -> Floor -> ICU (21 sequences).\n    *   Emergency -> ICU (41 sequences).\n6.  All paths leading to the \"Die\" node must pass through \"ICU\", as shown by the single incoming link to \"Die\" originating from \"ICU\".\n7.  The number of sequences following the link from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" is explicitly labelled as 36.\n8.  Since the \"ICU\" node is downstream from \"Emergency\" (reachable via Emergency -> ICU or Emergency -> Floor -> ICU), all 36 sequences that transition from \"ICU\" to \"Die\" must have previously passed through \"Emergency\".\n9.  Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is equal to the number of sequences entering the \"Die\" node, which is 36.\n\nThe number of sequences entering the 'Die' node is the number of patients who died. This number is directly given on the link leading to 'Die'. This link originates from 'ICU', which is always reached after 'Emergency' in this diagram structure. Thus, the 36 sequences reaching 'Die' all came via 'ICU', which they reached after arriving at 'Emergency'.",
