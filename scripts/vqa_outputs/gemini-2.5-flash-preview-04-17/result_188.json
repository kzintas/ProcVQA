I located the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.\n2.  I examined the outgoing links from the 'UMD Offense' node. These links lead to 'Rebound' (with a count of 34) and '\\_Exit' (with a count of 22).\n3.  I scanned all the node labels in the diagram: `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `Made Shot`, `Missed Shot`, `Rebound`, `UMD Offense`, `_Exit`.\n4.  I looked for a node representing a 'Steal' event. There is no node labeled 'Steal' or anything similar in the diagram.\n5.  Since 'Steal' is not represented as a node or an event in this specific visualization, it is not possible to determine how many steals occurred after 'UMD Offense' from the information provided.",
