  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "57",
  "llm_answer": "57",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. Examine the node-link diagram to identify nodes representing patients being discharged alive.\n2. Locate the node labeled 'Discharge-Alive -Exit' in the second column from the left. The number associated with this node is 37. This indicates 37 sequences end with discharge alive and exit.\n3. Locate the node labeled 'Discharge-Alive' in the third column from the left. The number associated with this node is 20. This indicates 20 sequences involve a discharge alive step. This is followed by an '_Exit' node with 24, which doesn't directly help here, but the 'Discharge-Alive' node itself represents 20 sequences reaching that state.\n4. Sum the numbers associated with all nodes indicating discharge alive.\n5. Total discharged alive = 37 (from column 2) + 20 (from column 3) = 57.",
