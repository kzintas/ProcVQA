  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. I examined the node-link diagram.\n2. I located the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\n3. I followed the link that leads into the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. This link originates from the \"Emergency\" node.\n4. The number associated with the link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 38. This indicates that 38 sequences (patients) followed this path.\n5. I also checked the link leading out of \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\", which also has the number 38, confirming that all 38 patients who reached \"Discharge-Alive\" then exited the process via this route.\n6. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38, as shown by the link count entering the \"Discharge-Alive\" state.",
