  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. I have examined the provided node-link diagram.\n2. The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from \"_Start\", moving to \"UNC Offense\", then \"UMD Offense\", and finally branching to \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit\". The \"Rebound\" path also leads to \"_Exit\".\n3. The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n4. I need to find information about \"free throws\" related to \"UMD Offense\" in the diagram.\n5. I can see the \"UMD Offense\" node. The links originating from this node represent the next events in the sequence. One link goes to \"Rebound\" (34 sequences) and another goes to \"_Exit\" (35 sequences).\n6. The diagram does not contain any nodes or labels that represent \"free throws\" or the outcome of specific scoring attempts like free throws. The transitions shown are from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit\".\n7. Since the diagram does not explicitly show free throws or their counts, the requested information cannot be determined from the visualization.",
