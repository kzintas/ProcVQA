There are two links from 'Emergency'.\n4.  One link goes to 'ICU', and the other goes to 'Discharge-Alive'.\n5.  The link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' has a numeric label next to it.\n6.  The numeric label associated with the link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' is 62. This number represents the count of sequences following that specific path.\n7.  Therefore, 62 sequences (or patients, based on the likely context of the diagram) went from Emergency to ICU.",
