  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The user asked for the number of shots made by the UMD offense. I examined the node-link diagram, specifically the node labeled \"UMD Offense\". There are two outgoing links from this node. One link leads to the \"Rebound\" node with a count of 34. This represents sequences where the UMD offense resulted in a rebound, which typically implies a missed shot. The other link leads directly to the \"_Exit\" node with a count of 35. This represents sequences where the UMD offense possession ended without a rebound. While a made shot would typically end a possession without a rebound (and thus likely fall into the 35 sequences ending at \"_Exit\"), the \"_Exit\" node could also represent other outcomes like turnovers, fouls ending the possession, or the end of a period, none of which necessarily involve a made shot. The diagram does not provide specific information or labels to distinguish between made shots and other outcomes that lead to the \"_Exit\" node from the \"UMD Offense\". Therefore, based solely on the information presented in the diagram, the number of shots made by UMD offense cannot be determined.",
  "full_response": "1.  The nodes involved are \"UMD Offense\", \"Rebound\", and \"_Exit\".\n2.  The links originating from \"UMD Offense\" are relevant. One link goes to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34. Another link goes to \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.\n3.  The question asks for the number of \"shots made\" by UMD offense.\n4.  The diagram shows sequences originating from the UMD Offense event. A sequence going to \"Rebound\" indicates a missed shot followed by a rebound. A sequence going to \"_Exit\" indicates the end of the offensive possession without a rebound.\n5.  The sequence ending in \"_Exit\" from \"UMD Offense\" (count 35) could represent a made shot, a turnover, or other events that end the possession without a rebound. The diagram does not differentiate between these possibilities.\n6.  Therefore, the number of \"shots made\" is not explicitly provided or derivable from the given labels and counts.\n\n<reasoning>The user asked for the number of shots made by the UMD offense.
