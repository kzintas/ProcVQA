  "full_response": "<reason>\n1.  I need to find the number of sequences that start from 'Emergency' and end up at 'Die'.\n2.  I locate the 'Emergency' node.\n3.  I examine the outgoing links from 'Emergency'. There are two: one to 'ICU' (62 sequences) and one to 'Discharge-Alive' (38 sequences).\n4.  I follow the link that could potentially lead to 'Die'. The link to 'Discharge-Alive' clearly does not lead to 'Die', as it goes to 'Discharge-Alive' and then '\\_Exit'.\n5.  I follow the link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU', which carries 62 sequences.\n6.  Now I look at the outgoing links from 'ICU'. There are two: one to 'Die' (36 sequences) and one to '\\_Exit' (26 sequences).\n7.  The link to 'Die' is the one I need. It shows 36 sequences.\n8.  This means that out of the 62 sequences that went from 'Emergency' to 'ICU', 36 subsequently went to 'Die'.\n9.  Therefore, 36 patients died after arriving at Emergency (specifically, after going through ICU).\n</reason>\n<answer>36</answer>",
