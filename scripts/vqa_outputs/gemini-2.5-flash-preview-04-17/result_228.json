  "question": "How many total missed shots were made by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "39",
  "llm_answer": "39",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "I have examined the node-link diagram.\nI am looking for nodes with the label \"Missed Shot\".\nI found three such nodes in the diagram, located in the first, second, and third columns.\nThe first \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 2.\nThe second \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 19.\nThe third \"Missed Shot\" node has a count of 18.\nThe question asks for the total number of missed shots made by both teams. The counts on the \"Missed Shot\" nodes represent the occurrences of this event within the sequences shown.\nTo find the total, I need to sum the counts associated with all \"Missed Shot\" nodes.\nTotal missed shots = Count from node 1 + Count from node 2 + Count from node 3\nTotal missed shots = 2 + 19 + 18\nTotal missed shots = 21 + 18\nTotal missed shots = 39",
