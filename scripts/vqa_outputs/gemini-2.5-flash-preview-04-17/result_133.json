  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of shots made directly after a Rebound.\n1. I located the node labeled \"Rebound\".\n2. I examined the links originating from the \"Rebound\" node.\n3. There are two links from \"Rebound\": one going to \"Made Shot\" and one going to \"\\_Exit\".\n4. I identified the link leading to the \"Made Shot\" node.\n5. I read the numeric label on this specific link, which is 15. This number represents the count of sequences that transitioned from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\".",
