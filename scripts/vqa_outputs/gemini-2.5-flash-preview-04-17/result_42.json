  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I examined the node-link diagram to find all nodes labeled 'Discharge-Alive'.\n2.  I found two nodes with the label 'Discharge-Alive'.\n3.  For the first 'Discharge-Alive' node, I identified the incoming link. This link originates from the 'Emergency' node and has a numerical label of 38. This indicates that 38 sequences (patients) followed this path.\n4.  For the second 'Discharge-Alive' node, I identified the incoming link. This link originates from a 'Floor' node (which is reached via 'ICU') and has a numerical label of 24. This indicates that 24 sequences (patients) followed this path.\n5.  To find the total number of patients discharged alive, I sum the counts from all incoming links to the 'Discharge-Alive' nodes: 38 + 24.\n6.  The sum is 62.",
