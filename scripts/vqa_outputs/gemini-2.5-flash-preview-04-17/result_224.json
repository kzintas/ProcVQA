  "question": "How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "1",
  "llm_answer": "1",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The user wants to know how many times a \"Jump Ball\" event followed a \"UNC Offense\" event according to the diagram.\nI need to locate the \"UNC Offense\" nodes and check if there are any outgoing links pointing directly to a \"Jump Ball\" node.\nThe diagram shows four main starting points or sequences.\nIn the first sequence column, the flow is \"\\_Start\" (2) -> \"UNC Offense\" (2). From \"UNC Offense\", there are links leading to subsequent events. One of these links points to \"Jump Ball\". The number next to the \"Jump Ball\" node is 1, and the link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" represents 1 sequence.\nIn the second sequence column, the flow is \"\\_Start\" (19) -> \"UNC Offense\" (19) -> \"Rebound\" (19). There is no \"Jump Ball\" node directly after \"UNC Offense\" in this path.\nIn the third sequence column, the flow is \"\\_Start\" (33) -> \"UNC Offense\" (33) -> \"Made Shot\" (28) and other paths. There is no \"Jump Ball\" node directly after \"UNC Offense\" in this path.\nIn the fourth sequence column, the flow is \"\\_Start\" (15) -> \"UNC Offense\" (15) -> \"Foul\" (15). There is no \"Jump Ball\" node directly after \"UNC Offense\" in this path.\nTherefore, only one path explicitly shows a \"Jump Ball\" event immediately following a \"UNC Offense\" event, and the count for this path is 1.\nThe relevant elements are the \"UNC Offense\" node and the \"Jump Ball\" node in the first column, and the link connecting them with its associated count. The count on the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" is 1. This represents 1 sequence where Jump Ball occurred after UNC Offense.",
