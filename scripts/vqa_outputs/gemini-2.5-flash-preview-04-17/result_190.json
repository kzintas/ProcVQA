  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "23",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "1. Identify the relevant elements: I examined the nodes labeled \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\" and all the links connected to them.\n2. Describe the thought process: The question asks for the number of times 'UMD Offense' transitioned directly from 'UNC Offense'. This corresponds to the count on a directed link originating from the \"UNC Offense\" node and terminating at the \"UMD Offense\" node. I visually scanned the diagram for such a link. I found links going out of \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" (22) and \"Missed Shot\" (24). I found links going into \"UMD Offense\" from \"Made Shot\" (22) and \"Missed Shot\" (24), and also a link originating from \"UNC Offense\" directly to \"Made Shot\" (23) - this seems to be an alternative path from UNC Offense to Made Shot, potentially indicating different types of 'Made Shot' events or a different interpretation of the diagram layout/links. Let me re-examine the links from UNC Offense. There are links from UNC Offense to Made Shot (labelled 22) and Missed Shot (labelled 24). There is also a curved link from UNC Offense going *around* Made Shot and connecting to UMD Offense, labelled 23. This curved link represents a direct transition from UNC Offense to UMD Offense. I initially missed this curved link. Let me re-evaluate based on this curved link.\n\nRe-evaluating:\nLooking carefully again, there is a curved link starting from \"UNC Offense\" and ending at \"UMD Offense\", with the numerical label \"23\" next to it. This link directly represents the transition from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\". The label \"23\" indicates the number of sequences following this direct path.\n\nSo, the number of times UMD Offense transitioned directly from UNC Offense is 23.",
