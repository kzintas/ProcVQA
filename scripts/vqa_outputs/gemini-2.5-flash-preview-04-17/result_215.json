  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "<reason>\nThe user wants to know the number of free throws made by UMD Offense based on the provided node-link diagram.\nI will examine the diagram for nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\" and their preceding nodes and labels to identify if they are associated with \"UMD Offense\".\n\n1.  Scan the diagram for nodes labeled \"Made Free Throw\". I find \"Made Free Throw\" nodes in the third column.\n2.  Observe the sequence leading to these \"Made Free Throw\" nodes in the third column: \"_Start (15)\" -> \"UNC Offense (15)\" -> \"Foul (15)\" -> \"Made Free Throw (13)\" and \"Made Free Throw (8)\".\n3.  Note the node following the \"Made Free Throw (8)\" node in this sequence is \"UMD Offense (8)\".\n4.  Evaluate if the diagram explicitly states or shows a link indicating that the \"Made Free Throw\" events were performed *by* UMD Offense. The sequence shows the free throws happen after a \"Foul\" during \"UNC Offense\". While fouls during an opponent's offense often lead to free throws for the other team, the diagram does not explicitly label the \"Made Free Throw\" node as being performed by \"UMD Offense\". The \"UMD Offense\" node appears *after* the Made Free Throw events in this specific path, suggesting UMD is on offense *after* the free throws.\n5.  Check other columns. No \"Made Free Throw\" nodes are present in columns 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nThe diagram shows \"Made Free Throw\" events occurred, but it does not attribute them directly to \"UMD Offense\" as the team making the free throws. The sequence in which they appear follows \"UNC Offense\" and \"Foul\". The \"UMD Offense\" node in that column appears downstream, indicating a state *after* the free throws. Therefore, the number of free throws made *by UMD Offense* cannot be determined solely from this visualization.\n</reason>\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
