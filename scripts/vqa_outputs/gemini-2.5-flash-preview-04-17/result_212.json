  "question": "How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?",
  "true_answer": "50",
  "llm_answer": "50",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. Identify all nodes labeled 'Rebound' in the diagram.\n2. Locate the numerical label next to each 'Rebound' node, which represents the number of sequences passing through that node.\n3. The diagram shows four 'Rebound' nodes with counts:\n    - In the first column, a 'Rebound' node with a count of 7.\n    - In the second column, an upper 'Rebound' node with a count of 14.\n    - In the second column, a lower 'Rebound' node with a count of 11.\n    - In the fourth column, a 'Rebound' node with a count of 18.\n4. Sum the counts from all 'Rebound' nodes: 7 + 14 + 11 + 18 = 50.\n5. This total sum represents the total number of rebounds made in the sequences shown in the diagram. The question asks for the total number of rebounds by both teams, and the diagram shows all events labeled 'Rebound', implying these are the total rebounds captured in these sequences. The diagram does not distinguish between teams for the 'Rebound' event itself, only showing the total counts. Therefore, the sum of all 'Rebound' nodes is the answer.",
