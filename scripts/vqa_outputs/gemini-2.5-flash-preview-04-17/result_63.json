One goes to a node labeled 'Die' and the other goes to a node labeled '_Exit'.\n4.  The question asks about patients going to the 'Floor' after the 'ICU'. I scanned the diagram for any node labeled 'Floor'.\n5.  There is no node labeled 'Floor' in the entire diagram, and specifically, no link from 'ICU' points to a 'Floor' node.\n6.  Since the visualization does not show any pathway from 'ICU' to 'Floor', I cannot determine how many patients followed this path.",
