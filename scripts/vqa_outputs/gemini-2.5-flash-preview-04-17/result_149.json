This link has a value of 34, indicating 34 sequences followed the path from Rebound to _Exit.\nThere are no other outgoing links from the \"Rebound\" node.\nThere is no node or link in the diagram that explicitly represents a \"shot made\" event following the \"Rebound\" node.\nTherefore, I cannot determine from this diagram how many shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
