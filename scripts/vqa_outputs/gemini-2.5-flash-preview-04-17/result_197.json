  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?",
  "true_answer": "69",
  "llm_answer": "0",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of times UMD Offense transitioned directly from UNC Offense. I examined the diagram to find a link connecting the node 'UNC Offense' directly to the node 'UMD Offense'. I found links going from 'UNC Offense' to 'Made Shot' and 'Missed Shot'. I also found links coming into 'UMD Offense' from 'Made Shot' and 'Missed Shot'. There is no direct link depicted in the diagram that goes straight from 'UNC Offense' to 'UMD Offense'. Therefore, based on the explicit pathways shown, this specific direct transition did not occur. The diagram shows that after UNC Offense, the sequence proceeds to either 'Made Shot' or 'Missed Shot', and *then* from these outcomes, the sequence can proceed to 'UMD Offense'. The question specifically asks for the direct transition *from* UNC Offense *to* UMD Offense. Since this direct link is absent in the visualization, the number of such transitions is zero.",
  "full_response": "1. Identify the relevant nodes: \"UNC Offense\" and \"UMD Offense\".\n2. Examine the links originating from the \"UNC Offense\" node. There are links connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" (labeled 22) and from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Missed Shot\" (labeled 24).\n3. Examine the links terminating at the \"UMD Offense\" node. There are links connecting \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" (labeled 22) and from \"Missed Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" (labeled 24).\n4. There is no direct link shown in the diagram from the \"UNC Offense\" node to the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n5. The diagram shows transitions from \"UNC Offense\" leading to outcomes (\"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\"), and *then* transitions from these outcomes leading to \"UMD Offense\".\n6. Since there is no direct link representing a transition solely from \"UNC Offense\" to \"UMD Offense\", the number of times this specific transition occurred according to the diagram is zero.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the number of times UMD Offense transitioned directly from UNC Offense.
