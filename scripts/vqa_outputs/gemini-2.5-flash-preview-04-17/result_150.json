  "reasoning": "The user is asking for the total number of shots made by UMD offense based on the provided node-link diagram.\nI need to examine the nodes and links related to \"UMD Offense\".\nThe diagram shows the following sequence: \"_Start\" -> \"UNC Offense\" -> \"UMD Offense\". There are 69 sequences that reach the \"UMD Offense\" node.\nFrom the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are two outgoing links:\n1. To \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\n2. To \"_Exit\" with a count of 35.\nThe sum of outgoing sequences (34 + 35 = 69) matches the incoming sequences to \"UMD Offense\".\nThe question asks specifically about \"shots made\".\nThe diagram shows the states or outcomes of the UMD offense possession as \"Rebound\" or \"_Exit\".\nA \"Rebound\" outcome typically follows a missed shot.\nAn \"_Exit\" outcome could represent various ways a possession ends, including a made shot, a turnover, a foul ending the possession, or the end of a period.\nThe diagram does not explicitly show a node or a link labeled \"Shot Made\" or provide a breakdown of what the \"_Exit\" state represents in terms of specific actions like shots made.\nTherefore, based *only* on the information provided in this diagram, it is not possible to determine how many shots were made by the UMD offense. The diagram does not contain this specific information.",
