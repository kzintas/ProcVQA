  "full_response": "<reason>\nThe question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. I need to identify all paths that end with the state \"Discharge-Alive\" and sum the number of sequences along those paths.\nLooking at the diagram, there are two distinct pathways that lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node:\n1.  From the \"Emergency\" node, there is a direct link to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The number on this link is 38.\n2.  From the \"ICU\" node, there is a link to a \"Floor\" node, and then a link from that \"Floor\" node to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node. The number on the link from \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" is 24.\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, I need to sum the counts from these two paths.\nTotal discharged alive = (Patients from Emergency -> Discharge-Alive) + (Patients from Floor -> Discharge-Alive)\nTotal discharged alive = 38 + 24 = 62.\n</reason>\n<answer>62</answer>",
