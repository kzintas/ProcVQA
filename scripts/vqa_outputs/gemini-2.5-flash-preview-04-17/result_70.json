I am looking for information about patients who were discharged alive after going to a location labeled \"Floor\".\nI have inspected all the node labels in the diagram: `_Start`, `Arrival`, `Emergency`, `ICU`, `Die`, `Discharge-Alive`, and `_Exit`.\nThere is no node explicitly labeled \"Floor\" in this visualization.\nSince the node \"Floor\" does not appear in the diagram, I cannot identify any paths that include \"Floor\" and then lead to \"Discharge-Alive\".\nTherefore, the number of patients who followed such a path cannot be determined from the information presented in the diagram.",
