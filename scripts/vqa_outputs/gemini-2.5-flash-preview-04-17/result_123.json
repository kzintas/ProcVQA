  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "<reason>\n1.  I located the node labeled \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  I identified all the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node. These links represent the possible subsequent events.\n3.  The outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\" lead to the nodes: \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Made Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\n4.  The counts associated with these links are:\n    *   To \"Rebound\": 34\n    *   To \"Missed Shot\": 14\n    *   To \"Foul\": 10\n    *   To \"Made Shot\": 8\n    *   To \"_Exit\": 3\n5.  The question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound.\n6.  This means I need to sum the counts for all transitions from \"UMD Offense\" that are *not* to \"Rebound\".\n7.  Summing the counts for transitions to \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Made Shot\", and \"_Exit\": 14 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 35.\n8.  Alternatively, the total number of sequences starting from UMD Offense is the sum of all outgoing links: 34 + 14 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 69. Subtracting the number of sequences that transitioned to Rebound (34) from the total gives the number of sequences that did not transition to Rebound: 69 - 34 = 35. Both methods yield the same result.\n</reason>\n<answer>35</answer>",
