  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of shots made by UMD offense.\n1. I located the node labeled 'UMD Offense'.\n2. I traced the outgoing links from 'UMD Offense'. There are links leading to 'Rebound' (34 sequences), 'Missed Shot' (14 sequences), and '_Exit' (21 sequences).\n3. I looked for the node labeled 'Made Shot', which represents a made shot.\n4. The 'Made Shot' node is reached from the 'Rebound' node via a link with a count of 15.\n5. The path representing made shots originating from 'UMD Offense' is UMD Offense -> Rebound -> Made Shot.\n6. The number of sequences following the link from 'Rebound' to 'Made Shot' is 15. This represents the number of times this specific sequence occurred.\n7. There are no other paths from 'UMD Offense' that lead to the 'Made Shot' node.\n8. Therefore, the total number of made shots by UMD offense, as depicted in this diagram, is 15.",
