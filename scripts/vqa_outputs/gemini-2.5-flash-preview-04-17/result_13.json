  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. I examined the node-link diagram to find nodes representing patients being discharged alive.\n2. I located two nodes labeled 'Discharge-Alive'.\n3. I traced the incoming links to each 'Discharge-Alive' node to identify the number of patients following that specific path.\n4. The link from 'Emergency' to the first 'Discharge-Alive' node has a count of 38.\n5. The link from 'Floor' to the second 'Discharge-Alive' node has a count of 24.\n6. To find the total number of patients discharged alive, I summed the counts on all incoming links to 'Discharge-Alive' nodes: 38 + 24 = 62.\n7. Both 'Discharge-Alive' nodes are followed by a '_Exit' node, confirming these are final outcomes where patients were discharged alive.",
