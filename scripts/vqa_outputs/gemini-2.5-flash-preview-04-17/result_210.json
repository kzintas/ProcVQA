  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "I need to find the number of times a \"Jump Ball\" event directly followed a \"UNC Offense\" event in the provided node-link diagram.\nI will examine each pathway shown in the diagram from top to bottom. Each column represents a set of sequences starting from a common point (_Start).\nI will look for a node labeled \"UNC Offense\" and check if there is a directed link from it to a node labeled \"Jump Ball\".\n1. In the first column, the sequence starts with \"_Start\" (7 sequences), followed by \"UNC Offense\" (7 sequences). The next event is \"Missed Shot\" (7 sequences). No \"Jump Ball\" follows \"UNC Offense\" in this column.\n2. In the second column, the sequence starts with \"_Start\" (14 sequences), followed by \"UNC Offense\" (14 sequences). The next event is \"Rebound\" (14 sequences). No \"Jump Ball\" follows \"UNC Offense\" in this column.\n3. In the third column, the sequence starts with \"_Start\" (15 sequences), followed by \"UNC Offense\" (15 sequences). The next event is \"Foul\" (15 sequences). No \"Jump Ball\" follows \"UNC Offense\" in this column.\n4. In the fourth column, the sequence starts with \"_Start\" (5 sequences), followed by \"UNC Offense\" (5 sequences). The next event is \"Jump Ball\" (1 sequence) and \"UMD Offense\" (5 sequences). There is a link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\" with a count of 1.\n5. In the fifth column, the sequence starts with \"_Start\" (28 sequences), followed by \"UNC Offense\" (28 sequences). The next events are \"Rebound\" (18 sequences) and \"Made Shot\" (10 sequences). No \"Jump Ball\" follows \"UNC Offense\" in this column.\n\nOnly in the fourth column is there a direct connection from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Jump Ball\". The numeric label on the link between \"UNC Offense\" and \"Jump Ball\" is 1. This indicates that 1 sequence followed this specific path.\nTherefore, a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense 1 time.",
