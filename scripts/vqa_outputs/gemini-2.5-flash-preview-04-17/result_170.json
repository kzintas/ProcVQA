  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of 'Made Shot' events that occurred in sequences following 'UNC Offense' and preceding 'UMD Offense'. I need to trace the path in the diagram that starts from 'UNC Offense', goes through 'Made Shot', and then reaches 'UMD Offense'.\n\n1.  Locate the 'UNC Offense' node.\n2.  Identify the outgoing links from 'UNC Offense'. There are links to 'Made Shot' (22), 'Missed Shot' (15), 'Rebound' (9), and 'Foul' (15).\n3.  Focus on the link going to 'Made Shot', which has a value of 22. This means 22 sequences went from 'UNC Offense' to 'Made Shot'.\n4.  From the 'Made Shot' node, identify the outgoing links. There is a link to 'UMD Offense' with a value of 22.\n5.  This specific path is 'UNC Offense' -> 'Made Shot' -> 'UMD Offense', and the count on the link from 'Made Shot' to 'UMD Offense' is 22. This directly represents the number of sequences where a 'Made Shot' happened after 'UNC Offense' and was followed by 'UMD Offense'.\n\nThus, there were 22 instances of a made shot occurring after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense according to the diagram.",
