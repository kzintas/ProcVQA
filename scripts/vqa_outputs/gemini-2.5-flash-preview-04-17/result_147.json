  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",
  "llm_answer": "35",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. I located the node labeled \"UMD Offense\".\n2. I identified the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node. There are two outgoing links.\n3. I examined the destinations of these outgoing links. One link goes to \"Rebound\", and the other goes to \"\\_Exit\".\n4. I read the numeric labels associated with these links. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of 34. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"\\_Exit\" has a label of 35.\n5. The question asks for the number of times UMD Offense did *not* transition to a Rebound. This corresponds to the sequences that followed the path from \"UMD Offense\" to a node other than \"Rebound\". In this diagram, the only other destination is \"\\_Exit\".\n6. Therefore, the number of times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound is the count on the link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"\\_Exit\". This count is 35.",
