  "question": "How many steals occurred after UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of steals that occurred after the \"UMD Offense\" event. I located the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram. I examined the links coming out of \"UMD Offense\". These links lead to the nodes \"Rebound\" and \"\\_Exit\". I checked if either of these nodes, or any subsequent nodes reached from them, are labeled \"Steal\". Neither \"Rebound\" nor \"\\_Exit\" is labeled \"Steal\". Furthermore, there are no other paths shown originating from \"UMD Offense\" or from the nodes reached after \"UMD Offense\" that lead to an event labeled \"Steal\". There is no node labeled \"Steal\" anywhere in the diagram. Therefore, the diagram does not provide information about the occurrence of steals after \"UMD Offense\".",
  "full_response": "1.  Identify the \"UMD Offense\" node.\n2.  Examine the links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node. The links lead to the \"Rebound\" node and the \"\\_Exit\" node.\n3.  Check the labels of the nodes reachable directly or indirectly from \"UMD Offense\" via the displayed paths. The subsequent nodes are \"Rebound\" and \"\\_Exit\". There are no further nodes shown after these paths terminate.\n4.  Look for any node labeled \"Steal\" in the entire diagram. There is no node labeled \"Steal\" in the diagram.\n5.  Since there is no node or event labeled \"Steal\" shown in the diagram, it is impossible to determine if or how many steals occurred after \"UMD Offense\" based solely on this visualization.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the number of steals that occurred after the \"UMD Offense\" event.
