  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of patients who were discharged alive *directly* after arriving at Emergency. This corresponds to a sequence segment starting at the 'Emergency' node and immediately going to the 'Discharge-Alive' node.\nFollowing the links originating from the 'Emergency' node, there are two outgoing links:\n- One goes to 'ICU' with a value of 62.\n- One goes to 'Discharge-Alive' with a value of 38.\nThe link going directly to 'Discharge-Alive' represents the flow of patients from Emergency to Discharge-Alive without any intermediate steps shown in the diagram. The label on this link is 38. This means 38 patients followed this path segment.",
