  "reasoning": "1.  I examined the node-link diagram to find the relevant nodes and links for the question \"How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?\".\n2.  I located the node labeled 'Rebound'.\n3.  I looked for outgoing links from the 'Rebound' node.\n4.  I found a link pointing from 'Rebound' to the node labeled 'Made Shot'.\n5.  I read the numerical label associated with this specific link, which is 15.\n6.  This label indicates that 15 sequences transition directly from the 'Rebound' event to the 'Made Shot' event.",
