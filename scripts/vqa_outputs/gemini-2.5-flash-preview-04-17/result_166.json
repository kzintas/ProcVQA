  "question": "How many fouls were made after UNC Offense and before UMD offense? ",
  "true_answer": "8",
  "llm_answer": "8",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of fouls made after 'UNC Offense' and before 'UMD offense'.\n1. I located the 'UNC Offense' node and the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.\n2. I looked for nodes representing 'Foul' events that occur in sequences flowing from 'UNC Offense' towards 'UMD Offense'.\n3. There is a 'Foul' node directly connected by a link from 'UNC Offense'. This indicates sequences where a foul occurred immediately after 'UNC Offense'.\n4. The link from 'UNC Offense' to this 'Foul' node has a numerical label of 8. This means 8 sequences followed this specific path segment (UNC Offense -> Foul).\n5. The 'Foul' node is positioned vertically above the 'UMD Offense' node, indicating that this 'Foul' event occurs chronologically after 'UNC Offense' and before the sequence reaches 'UMD Offense'.\n6. There are no other 'Foul' nodes in the diagram that are positioned between the 'UNC Offense' level and the 'UMD Offense' level.\n7. Therefore, the number of fouls made after 'UNC Offense' and before 'UMD offense' is the number of sequences that transitioned from 'UNC Offense' to the 'Foul' node, which is 8.\n\nAlthough there is a discrepancy in the outgoing link counts from the 'Foul' node (5 to Made Free Throw + 4 to UMD Offense = 9), this does not change the fact that 8 sequences arrived at the 'Foul' node from 'UNC Offense', representing 8 foul events occurring at that point in the sequence. The question asks about the number of fouls made, not the flow beyond that point.",
