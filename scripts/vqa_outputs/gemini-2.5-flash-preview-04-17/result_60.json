  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "38",
  "llm_answer": "38",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. I need to find the node that represents being discharged alive. This node is labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2. I need to determine the number of sequences that reach this state. The diagram shows a directed link leading *into* the \"Discharge-Alive\" node.\n3. This link originates from the \"Emergency\" node.\n4. The link from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\" has a numerical label of 38.\n5. This number represents the count of sequences that followed this specific path segment, meaning 38 sequences transitioned from \"Emergency\" to \"Discharge-Alive\". Since \"Discharge-Alive\" is a specific outcome state, this number represents the total count of patients who reached this state.\n6. The diagram also shows an outgoing link from \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\" with the label 38, confirming that all sequences reaching \"Discharge-Alive\" then exited.\n7. Therefore, the total number of patients discharged alive is 38.",
