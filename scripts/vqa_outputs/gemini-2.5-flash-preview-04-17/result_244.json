  "full_response": "<reason>The question asks for the total number of shots made by the UNC offense. In the diagram, successful shots are represented by nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" and \"Made Free Throw\". I need to identify all sequences that start with \"UNC Offense\" and lead to these \"Made Shot\" or \"Made Free Throw\" nodes *before* possession potentially changes to \"UMD Offense\".\n\n1.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Jump Ball` (1) -> `Missed Shot` (2) -> `Made Shot` (2). This path originates from UNC Offense and ends with a Made Shot node with a value of 2. Since no 'UMD Offense' node appears before the 'Made Shot' node in this specific pathway, these 2 shots are counted as made by UNC offense.\n2.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (14) -> `UNC Offense` (14) -> `Missed Shot` (14) -> `Rebound` (14) -> `UMD Offense` (13). This path shows possession changing to UMD Offense. Any subsequent \"Made Shot\" or \"Made Free Throw\" nodes in this branch are made by UMD, not UNC. The `Made Shot` (7) node is downstream from the `UMD Offense` node, so it is not counted for UNC.\n3.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (12) -> `UNC Offense` (12) -> `Rebound` (5) -> `Foul` (9) -> `Made Free Throw` (10). This path originates from UNC Offense and reaches a \"Made Free Throw\" node with a value of 10. Since no 'UMD Offense' node appears before the 'Made Free Throw' node in this pathway, these 10 shots are counted as made by UNC offense.\n4.  Continuing the previous path: `Made Free Throw` (10) leads to `Made Free Throw` (6). These 6 shots are also part of the same UNC offense sequence. Count these 6.\n5.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (14) -> `UNC Offense` (14) -> `Steal` (6) -> `UMD Offense` (10). This path shows possession changing to UMD Offense. Any subsequent \"Made Shot\" or \"Made Free Throw\" nodes in this branch are made by UMD, not UNC. The `Made Shot` (3) node is downstream from the `UMD Offense` node, so it is not counted for UNC.\n6.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (9) -> `UNC Offense` (9) -> `Missed Shot` (9) -> `UMD Offense` (8). This path shows possession changing to UMD Offense. Any subsequent shots are made by UMD. No Made Shot/Free Throw nodes are reached in this branch anyway.\n7.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (18) -> `UNC Offense` (18) -> `Made Shot` (17). This path originates from UNC Offense and reaches a \"Made Shot\" node with a value of 17. Since no 'UMD Offense' node appears before the 'Made Shot' node in this pathway, these 17 shots are counted as made by UNC offense.\n\nNow, sum the counts of \"Made Shot\" and \"Made Free Throw\" nodes identified as being made by UNC offense:\n- Made Shot: 2 + 17 = 19\n- Made Free Throw: 10 + 6 = 16\nTotal shots made by UNC offense = 19 + 16 = 35.\n\nThe nodes relevant are the \"_Start\" nodes leading to \"UNC Offense\", the \"UNC Offense\" nodes themselves, the \"Made Shot\" nodes, the \"Made Free Throw\" nodes, the \"UMD Offense\" nodes (as indicators of possession change), and the numeric labels next to the nodes/links. I followed the paths from UNC Offense beginnings and summed the values of \"Made Shot\" and \"Made Free Throw\" nodes reached before a \"UMD Offense\" node indicates a turnover.\n\nCalculations:\nPath 1: Made Shot (2)\nPath 3 & 4: Made Free Throw (10 + 6 = 16)\nPath 6: Made Shot (17)\nTotal = 2 + 16 + 17 = 35.\n</reason>\n<answer>35</answer>",
