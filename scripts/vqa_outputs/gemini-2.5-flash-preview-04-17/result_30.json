  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "I need to find the number of sequences that ended in \"Discharge-Alive\".\nI will look for the node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\nI see a node labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\nThere is a link entering \"Discharge-Alive\" from \"Emergency\" with a value of 38.\nThere is a link exiting \"Discharge-Alive\" to \"_Exit\" with a value of 38.\nThe number associated with the link entering the \"Discharge-Alive\" node represents the number of sequences that reached this state.\nThe number associated with the link exiting the \"Discharge-Alive\" node also represents the number of sequences that passed through this state before exiting.\nBoth values are 38. This indicates that 38 sequences ended with \"Discharge-Alive\" before exiting the process.\nTherefore, 38 patients were discharged alive.",
