  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "23",
  "llm_answer": "11",
  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "<reasoning>1.  Identify the starting node specified in the question: \"UNC Offense\".\n2.  Identify the event type we are looking for: \"Made Shot\".\n3.  Identify the condition on the subsequent event: it must occur *before* \"UMD Offense\". In the context of this diagram, this means the path does not lead to the \"UMD Offense\" node after the \"Made Shot\" event.\n4.  Trace the outgoing paths from \"UNC Offense\" that eventually lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n    *   Path 1: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" (23 sequences) -> \"Made Shot\" (4 sequences). This \"Made Shot\" node leads to \"_Exit\". This fits the criteria (after UNC Offense, before UMD Offense). The number of sequences is 4.\n    *   Path 2: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Missed Shot\" (15 sequences) -> \"Rebound\" (9 sequences) -> \"Made Shot\" (7 sequences). This \"Made Shot\" node leads to \"_Exit\". This fits the criteria (after UNC Offense, before UMD Offense). The number of sequences is 7.\n    *   Path 3: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Foul\" (8 sequences) -> \"Made Free Throw\" (5 sequences) -> subsequent events are \"Turnover\" or another \"Made Free Throw\", eventually leading to \"UMD Offense\" or other outcomes not relevant to \"Made Shot\".\n    *   Path 4: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Turnover\" (24 sequences) -> \"UMD Offense\".\n    *   Path 5: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Free Throw\" (4 sequences) -> \"UMD Offense\".\n5.  The only paths showing a \"Made Shot\" after \"UNC Offense\" that do not then proceed to \"UMD Offense\" are the two identified: \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"Made Shot\" (4 sequences) and \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Missed Shot\" -> \"Rebound\" -> \"Made Shot\" (7 sequences).\n6.  Sum the number of sequences for these identified paths: 4 + 7 = 11.\n7.  Confirm that these sequences originate from \"UNC Offense\" and the \"Made Shot\" event is followed by \"_Exit\", meaning they do not continue to \"UMD Offense\". This is correct based on the diagram. The question asks for the number of *made shots* that fit the criteria, which corresponds to the flow count on the links leading to the \"Made Shot\" nodes in these specific sequences.\n8.  The total number of such made shots is the sum of the counts on these paths.<answer>11</answer>",
