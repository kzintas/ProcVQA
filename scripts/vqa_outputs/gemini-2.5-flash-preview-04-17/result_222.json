  "reasoning": "1.  Identify the events of interest: \"UMD Offense\" and \"Made Free Throw\".\n2.  Understand the question: How many times did \"Made Free Throw\" occur immediately after \"UMD Offense\" in a sequence?\n3.  Examine the diagram to find nodes labeled \"UMD Offense\".\n4.  Trace the outgoing links from each \"UMD Offense\" node.\n5.  For each outgoing link from a \"UMD Offense\" node, check if the destination node is labeled \"Made Free Throw\".\n6.  In the diagram:\n    -   There is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 9 sequences following \"Foul\" (from UNC Offense). The outgoing links from this \"UMD Offense\" node lead to \"Foul\" (3 sequences) and \"_Exit\" (13 sequences from the parent node). No link to \"Made Free Throw\".\n    -   There is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 20 sequences following \"Missed Shot\" (from UNC Offense path). The outgoing links from this \"UMD Offense\" node lead to \"Rebound\" (17 sequences) and \"Made Shot\" (9 sequences). No link to \"Made Free Throw\". (Note: The link labels 17 and 9 add up to 26, which is the total flow into the parent \"Missed Shot\" node, suggesting these might be counts from the parent node's flow, not necessarily from the 20 UMD Offense sequences. However, the visual link originates from \"UMD Offense\". Let's check further). The 20 sequences entering the UMD Offense node split into Rebound (17) and Made Shot (9). This sum is 26, which doesn't match the input 20. This indicates that the count next to the link represents the number of sequences following *that specific path* from the previous step, not necessarily the split from the \"UMD Offense\" node itself. Re-examining the flow: 26 sequences enter the column, 26 go to UNC Offense, 26 to Rebound, 25 to Missed Shot. From Missed Shot, 20 go to UMD Offense. From this UMD Offense (20), 17 go to Rebound and 9 go to Made Shot. The sum is 26. This still seems inconsistent (20 entering UMD Offense, but 26 leaving to Rebound and Made Shot). Let's focus on the *existence* of a link from UMD Offense to Made Free Throw. There is no such link.\n    -   There is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 18 sequences following \"Made Shot\" (from UNC Offense path). The outgoing links from this \"UMD Offense\" node lead to \"Missed Shot\" (12 sequences). No link to \"Made Free Throw\". (Again, 18 entering UMD Offense, 12 leaving to Missed Shot. Where do the other 6 go? They might go to \"_Exit\" or another state not explicitly shown originating from *this* UMD Offense node. However, the lack of a link to \"Made Free Throw\" is clear).\n    -   There is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 7 sequences following \"Turnover\" (from UNC Offense path). The outgoing links from this \"UMD Offense\" node lead to \"_Exit\" (7 sequences). No link to \"Made Free Throw\".\n7.  The only \"Made Free Throw\" node shown (with 12 sequences) is preceded by \"Foul\", which is preceded by \"UNC Offense\". This pathway represents UNC making free throws, not UMD.\n8.  Since no link originates from a \"UMD Offense\" node and terminates at a \"Made Free Throw\" node, the diagram does not show any sequences where UMD Offense made a free throw.\n9.  Therefore, the number of free throws made by UMD Offense cannot be determined from the visualization as being non-zero or specifically zero based on an explicit link representing UMD free throws. The visualization simply doesn't represent this event sequence occurring or doesn't capture it in this specific flow. Based on the explicit pathways shown, the information is not present.\n\nConclusion: The diagram does not show any sequences of \"UMD Offense\" -> \"Made Free Throw\". Thus, the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, as depicted in these specific pathways, is not available or represented.",
