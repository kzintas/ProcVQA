  "question": "How many free throws were made in total by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. I have examined the provided node-link diagram visualization.\n2. The diagram starts with \"_Start\", followed by \"UNC Offense\", then \"UMD Offense\".\n3. From the \"UMD Offense\" node, there are outgoing links to \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", \"Foul\", \"Made Shot\", and \"_Exit\". The counts for these paths are 34, 14, 10, 8, and 3 respectively.\n4. The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\n5. I looked for any nodes or links labeled \"free throw\" or information that would allow me to differentiate between field goals and free throws within the \"Made Shot\" or \"Missed Shot\" nodes.\n6. The diagram only shows general events like \"Made Shot\" and \"Missed Shot\" without specifying the type of shot (e.g., field goal, free throw).\n7. Therefore, the visualization does not provide the necessary information to determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.",
