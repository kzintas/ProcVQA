  "question": "How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?",
  "true_answer": "36",
  "llm_answer": "36",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  Locate the 'Emergency' node in the diagram.\n2.  Identify the outgoing links from 'Emergency'. There are two links, one going to 'ICU' (labeled 62) and one going to 'Discharge-Alive' (labeled 38). These represent the two immediate outcomes after 'Emergency'.\n3.  The question asks how many patients died *after* arriving at Emergency. Death is represented by the 'Die' node.\n4.  Trace the path from 'Emergency' that leads to the 'Die' node. The only path leading to 'Die' originates from the 'ICU' node.\n5.  Follow the path from 'Emergency' to 'ICU', which has a count of 62.\n6.  Follow the path from 'ICU' to 'Die', which has a count of 36.\n7.  This means that out of the 62 patients who went to ICU from Emergency, 36 subsequently died.\n8.  The other path from 'Emergency' leads to 'Discharge-Alive', and none of those patients go to the 'Die' node according to the diagram.\n9.  Therefore, the number of patients who died after arriving at Emergency is the number of patients who followed the path 'Emergency' -> 'ICU' -> 'Die', which is 36.",
