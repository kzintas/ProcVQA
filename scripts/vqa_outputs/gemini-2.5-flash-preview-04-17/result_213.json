  "reasoning": "I need to find all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" in the provided node-link diagram and sum the numeric labels associated with the links leading into or the nodes themselves (which represent the sequence count reaching that point).\n\n1.

In the third column (starting with 15 sequences), there is no \"Made Shot\" node. There is a \"Made Free Throw\" node, but the question asks for \"Made Shot\".\n5.
