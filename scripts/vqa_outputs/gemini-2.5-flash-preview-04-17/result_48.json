  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive?",
  "true_answer": "62",
  "llm_answer": "62",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive. I need to find all paths that lead to a \"Discharge-Alive\" state and sum the counts associated with those paths.\nLooking at the diagram, there are two distinct nodes labeled \"Discharge-Alive\".\nThe first \"Discharge-Alive\" node is reached directly from \"Emergency\" via a link labeled \"38\". This means 38 sequences (patients) followed the path Emergency -> Discharge-Alive.\nThe second \"Discharge-Alive\" node is reached from a \"Floor\" node, which in turn is reached from \"ICU\", which is reached from \"Emergency\". The link from \"Floor\" to this \"Discharge-Alive\" node is labeled \"24\". This means 24 sequences (patients) followed the path Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive.\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, I sum the counts from all incoming links to all \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes: 38 + 24.\nCalculation: 38 + 24 = 62.\nThe total number of patients discharged alive is 62.",
  "full_response": "1.  Identify the nodes labeled \"Discharge-Alive\". There are two such nodes.\n2.  Identify the links pointing to these \"Discharge-Alive\" nodes and their corresponding numeric labels.\n    *   A link from \"Emergency\" to the right-hand \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a label of 38.\n    *   A link from the lower \"Floor\" node to the left-hand \"Discharge-Alive\" node has a label of 24.\n3.  Sum the counts from all links leading into a \"Discharge-Alive\" node to find the total number of patients discharged alive.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive.
