  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",

  "is_correct": false,
  "reasoning": "The user wants to know the total number of missed shots that occur in sequences starting with 'UNC Offense' and followed later in the sequence by 'UMD Offense'. I need to examine the pathways shown in the node-link diagram.\n\n1.  Identify all nodes labeled 'Missed Shot'. There are 'Missed Shot' nodes with values 2 (Column 1), 25 (Column 3), and 12 (Column 4).\n2.  For each 'Missed Shot' node, trace back to see if it originates from an 'UNC Offense' node (either directly or indirectly).\n    *   'Missed Shot' (2 in Column 1) is linked from 'UNC Offense' (2 in Column 1) via 'Jump Ball' (1) and directly from 'UNC Offense' (2). So, it is after 'UNC Offense'.\n    *   'Missed Shot' (25 in Column 3) is linked from 'Rebound' (26 in Column 3), which is linked from 'UNC Offense' (26 in Column 3). So, it is after 'UNC Offense'.\n    *   'Missed Shot' (12 in Column 4) is linked from 'Made Shot' (20 in Column 4), which is linked from 'UNC Offense' (21 in Column 4). So, it is after 'UNC Offense'.\n    All identified 'Missed Shot' nodes occur after 'UNC Offense'.\n3.  For each 'Missed Shot' node, trace forward to see if there is a subsequent 'UMD Offense' node explicitly linked in the diagram.\n    *   From 'Missed Shot' (2 in Column 1), the path goes to 'Made Shot' (2) and then '_Exit' (2). There is no explicit link to a 'UMD Offense' node after this 'Missed Shot'.\n    *   From 'Missed Shot' (25 in Column 3), there are explicit links to 'UMD Offense' (20) and 'Rebound' (17). The link to 'UMD Offense' (20) means that 20 of these 'Missed Shot' events are followed by a 'UMD Offense' event in the sequence. These 20 events satisfy the condition. The link to 'Rebound' (17) does not lead immediately to 'UMD Offense' based on the shown links (Rebound links to Made Shot), so these 17 do not fit the specific condition of the diagram flow showing Missed Shot directly or indirectly leading to UMD Offense after the Missed Shot.\n    *   From 'Missed Shot' (12 in Column 4), there are no explicit outgoing links shown in the diagram. Therefore, based solely on what is explicitly shown, I cannot determine if these 12 'Missed Shot' events are followed by a 'UMD Offense' event.\n4.  Sum the counts of the 'Missed Shot' nodes that satisfy both conditions (after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense, based on explicit links).\n    *   Only the link from 'Missed Shot' (25) to 'UMD Offense' (20) in Column 3 explicitly shows 'Missed Shot' being followed by 'UMD Offense' in a path originating from 'UNC Offense'.\n    *   The number of sequences following this specific path segment is 20.\n\nTherefore, the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, based on the explicit links shown in the diagram, is 20. The other 'Missed Shot' nodes either do not have a subsequent 'UMD Offense' shown or the link to a potential subsequent node is not explicitly drawn. Following the instruction to answer *solely* based on what is explicitly shown, I count only the path where the link from 'Missed Shot' to 'UMD Offense' is present.",
