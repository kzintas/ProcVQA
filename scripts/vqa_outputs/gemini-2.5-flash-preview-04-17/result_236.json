  "question": "How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "3",
  "llm_answer": "3",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The user is asking for the number of made free throws by UMD Offense. I need to trace pathways in the diagram where an event labeled \"UMD Offense\" is followed by an event labeled \"Made Free Throw\" and sum the counts on the links representing these transitions.\n\n1.  I examine the diagram column by column, looking for \"UMD Offense\" nodes.\n2.  In the second column, there is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 17 sequences. The links outgoing from this node lead to \"Rebound\" (15 sequences) and \"Made Shot\" (8 sequences). There is no link from this \"UMD Offense\" node to a \"Made Free Throw\" node. (Note: 15+8 = 23, which is more than 17. This suggests the diagram might show sequences merging or the layout isn't strictly source-target. However, the link counts are the primary source of information for transitions). Let's focus on direct links originating from \"UMD Offense\" nodes.\n3.  In the third column, there is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 10 sequences. There is a link outgoing from this \"UMD Offense\" node to a \"Made Free Throw\" node. The count associated with this link is 3. This represents 3 sequences where UMD Offense made a free throw.\n4.  In the fourth column, there is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 7 sequences. The outgoing link leads to \"_Exit\". There is no link to \"Made Free Throw\".\n5.  In the fifth column, there is a \"UMD Offense\" node with 25 sequences. The outgoing links lead to \"Missed Shot\" (19 sequences) and \"_Exit\" (implied count from 25 sequences that don't go to Missed Shot, i.e., 25 - 19 = 6 sequences). There is no link from this \"UMD Offense\" node to a \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n6.  The only direct link from a \"UMD Offense\" node to a \"Made Free Throw\" node has a count of 3.\n\nTherefore, based on the diagram, 3 free throws were made following a UMD Offense sequence. The diagram shows a \"Made Free Throw\" node with 11 sequences before the \"UMD Offense\" node (10 sequences) in column 3, but this does not represent free throws made *by* UMD Offense; it represents free throws made *before* the UMD Offense possession began in those 10 sequences. The question asks for free throws made *by* UMD Offense, which is represented by the flow from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Made Free Throw\".",
