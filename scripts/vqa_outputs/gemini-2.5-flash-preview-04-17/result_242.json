The count is 14.\n3. Find the node labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the fourth pathway starting from _Start (14). The count is 9.\n4. Find the node labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the fifth pathway starting from _Start (9). The count is 6.\n5. Find the node labeled \"Missed Shot\" in the sixth pathway starting from _Start (18). The count is 12.\n6. Sum these counts: 2 + 14 + 9 + 6 + 12 = 43.\nThis sum represents the total number of sequences that passed through a \"Missed Shot\" node across all shown pathways. The question asks for the total number of missed shots by both teams, and these nodes represent those events.",
