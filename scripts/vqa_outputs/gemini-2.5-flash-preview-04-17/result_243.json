  "full_response": "<reason>The user is asking for the number of made free throws by UMD Offense based on the node-link diagram. I need to trace pathways originating from a \"UMD Offense\" node and see if they lead to a \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n\n1.  Scan the diagram for \"UMD Offense\" nodes. These appear in the second column (linked from \"Missed Shot\"), the fourth column (linked from \"UNC Offense\" or \"Steal\" implicitly from \"UNC Offense\"), the fifth column (linked from \"Missed Shot\"), and the sixth column (linked from \"UNC Offense\").\n2.  Examine the links coming *from* these \"UMD Offense\" nodes:\n    *   In the second column, the \"UMD Offense\" node (count 13) links to \"Rebound\" (count 13) and \"Made Shot\" (count 7).\n    *   In the fourth column, the \"UMD Offense\" node (count 10) links to \"Made Shot\" (count 3) and _Exit (count 10-3=7).\n    *   In the fifth column, the \"UMD Offense\" node (count 8) links to \"Rebound\" (count 8) and \"Missed Shot\" (count 6).\n    *   In the sixth column, the \"UMD Offense\" node (count 15) links to \"Missed Shot\" (count 12) and _Exit (count 15-12=3).\n3.  Scan the diagram for \"Made Free Throw\" nodes. These appear in the third column (two nodes, counts 10 and 6).\n4.  Check if any links connect a \"UMD Offense\" node to a \"Made Free Throw\" node. Based on step 2 and 3, there are no links originating from any \"UMD Offense\" node that point to a \"Made Free Throw\" node.\n5.  The \"Made Free Throw\" nodes in the third column are linked directly from the initial \"UNC Offense\" state of that column.\n6.  Therefore, the diagram does not show any instances of \"Made Free Throw\" events occurring after a \"UMD Offense\" event.\n\nBased on the available information in the diagram, I cannot determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense. The diagram shows Made Free Throws occurring after UNC Offense, but not after UMD Offense.</reason>\n<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
