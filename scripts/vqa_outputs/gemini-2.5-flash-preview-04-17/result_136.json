  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\nI have examined the node-link diagram.\nThe diagram shows sequences of events related to \"_Start\", \"UNC Offense\", and \"UMD Offense\".\nFrom \"UMD Offense\", paths lead to \"Rebound\", \"Missed Shot\", and \"_Exit\".\nThe path from \"Rebound\" leads to \"Made Shot\" or \"_Exit\".\nThe path from \"Made Shot\" leads to \"_Exit\".\nThe node \"Made Shot\" represents shots that were successfully made. However, the diagram does not specify the *type* of shot made (e.g., field goal, 3-pointer, free throw).\nThere is no node or link labeled \"Free Throw\" or similar.\nSince the visualization does not provide information specifically distinguishing free throws from other types of made shots, it is not possible to determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense solely based on this diagram.\nThe information about made shots (15 sequences ending in \"Made Shot\") includes all types of made shots, not just free throws.\nTherefore, the answer cannot be determined from the provided visualization.",
