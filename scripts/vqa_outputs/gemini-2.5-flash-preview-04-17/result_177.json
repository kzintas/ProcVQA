  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. The question asks for the number of made shots that occurred after 'UNC Offense' and before 'UMD Offense'.\n2. I need to trace the path starting from 'UNC Offense', going through 'Made Shot', and then reaching 'UMD Offense'.\n3. I locate the 'UNC Offense' node and the 'Made Shot' node. There is a directed link from 'UNC Offense' to 'Made Shot'. The label on this link is 22. This means 22 sequences went from 'UNC Offense' directly to 'Made Shot'.\n4. I locate the 'Made Shot' node and the 'UMD Offense' node. There is a directed link from 'Made Shot' to 'UMD Offense'. The label on this link is 22. This means 22 sequences went from 'Made Shot' directly to 'UMD Offense'.\n5. Since the link from 'UNC Offense' to 'Made Shot' has a count of 22, and the link from 'Made Shot' to 'UMD Offense' also has a count of 22, it indicates that all 22 sequences that reached 'Made Shot' from 'UNC Offense' subsequently proceeded to 'UMD Offense'.\n6. The number of made shots that were after 'UNC Offense' and before 'UMD Offense' is represented by the flow through the 'Made Shot' node coming from 'UNC Offense' and going to 'UMD Offense'. This flow is explicitly shown as 22.",
