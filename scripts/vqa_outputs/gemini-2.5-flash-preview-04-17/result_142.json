  "question": "How many total shots were made by UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I examined the node-link diagram.\n2.  I located the \"UMD Offense\" node, which represents the start of UMD's offensive sequences within the shown part of the diagram.\n3.  I followed the links originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node to identify subsequent events.\n4.  The links from \"UMD Offense\" go to \"Rebound\" (34), \"Missed Shot\" (14), and \"_Exit\" (21).\n5.  I need to find pathways that lead to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n6.  One pathway from \"UMD Offense\" leads to \"Rebound\" (34).\n7.  From \"Rebound\", there is a link to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 15.\n8.  From \"Made Shot\", there is a link to \"_Exit\" with a count of 15, confirming that these 15 sequences ended after the shot was made.\n9.  There are no other pathways from \"UMD Offense\" that lead to a \"Made Shot\" node (the other paths lead to \"Missed Shot\" or \"_Exit\" directly from \"UMD Offense\", or \"_Exit\" directly from \"Rebound\").\n10. Therefore, the total number of sequences originating from \"UMD Offense\" that resulted in a \"Made Shot\" is 15.",
