  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients who were discharged alive *after* going to the Floor.\nI need to find pathways in the diagram that include the sequence of events \"Floor\" followed by \"Discharge-Alive\".\nLooking at the diagram, there are two nodes labeled \"Floor\".\nLet's examine the paths leading *from* each \"Floor\" node:\n1.  The first \"Floor\" node receives sequences from \"Emergency\" (21). From this \"Floor\" node, the only outgoing link goes to \"ICU\" with a count of 21. There is no link from this \"Floor\" to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n2.  The second \"Floor\" node receives sequences from \"ICU\" (24). From this \"Floor\" node, the outgoing link goes to \"Discharge-Alive\" with a count of 24. This sequence matches the criteria: it goes through \"Floor\" and then to \"Discharge-Alive\".\n\nThe path is Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit. The segment relevant to the question is Floor -> Discharge-Alive. The number of sequences following this specific segment is explicitly labeled on the link between the second \"Floor\" node and the \"Discharge-Alive\" node. This number is 24.\n\nTherefore, 24 patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor (specifically, the Floor node that is reached after the ICU). There are no other pathways shown in the diagram where patients go to a \"Floor\" node and then subsequently to a \"Discharge-Alive\" node.",
