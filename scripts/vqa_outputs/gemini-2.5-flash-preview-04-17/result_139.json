  "question": "How many times did UMD Offense not transition to a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "35",

  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks how many times \"UMD Offense\" did not transition to \"Rebound\".\nFirst, I locate the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\nNext, I examine all the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node.\nThere are three outgoing links from \"UMD Offense\".\nOne link goes to \"Rebound\" with a count of 34.\nAnother link goes to \"Missed Shot\" with a count of 14.\nThe third link goes to \"_Exit\" with a count of 21.\nThe transitions *not* to \"Rebound\" are the transitions to \"Missed Shot\" and \"_Exit\".\nTo find the total number of times UMD Offense did not transition to Rebound, I need to sum the counts of the transitions to \"Missed Shot\" and \"_Exit\".\nSum = Count(UMD Offense -> Missed Shot) + Count(UMD Offense -> _Exit)\nSum = 14 + 21 = 35.\nTherefore, UMD Offense did not transition to Rebound 35 times.",
