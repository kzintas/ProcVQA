  "question": "How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?",
  "true_answer": "15",
  "llm_answer": "15",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. The user is asking for the number of sequences where a \"Made Shot\" event occurred directly after a \"Rebound\" event.\n2. I need to find the \"Rebound\" node in the diagram.\n3. I need to identify the outgoing links from the \"Rebound\" node.\n4. I need to check if there is a link directly connecting the \"Rebound\" node to a \"Made Shot\" node.\n5. The diagram shows a link originating from \"Rebound\" and pointing to \"Made Shot\".\n6. The number next to this link represents the count of sequences that followed this specific path.\n7. The number associated with the link from \"Rebound\" to \"Made Shot\" is 15.\n8. Therefore, 15 shots were made directly after a Rebound.",
