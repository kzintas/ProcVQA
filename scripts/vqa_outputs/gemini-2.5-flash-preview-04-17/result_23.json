  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of patients discharged alive *after* going to the 'Floor'.\nI need to trace the path(s) in the diagram that include 'Floor' followed by 'Discharge-Alive'.\nLooking at the diagram, the paths originate from 'Emergency'.\nFrom 'Emergency', sequences can go to 'ICU' (62) or 'Discharge-Alive' (38).\nThe path segment that includes 'Floor' originates from 'ICU'. From 'ICU', sequences go to 'Die' (36), 'Floor' (24), or '_Exit' (2).\nFollowing the path that goes to 'Floor', I see a link from 'ICU' to 'Floor' with a count of 24.\nFrom the 'Floor' node, there is a link going to 'Discharge-Alive' with a count of 24.\nThere is also a link from 'Floor' to '_Exit' (implied by the structure, but the count 24 is explicitly on the Discharge-Alive link).\nThe path segment 'Floor' -> 'Discharge-Alive' indicates patients who were discharged alive after being in the 'Floor'.\nThe number of sequences following this specific transition is given by the label on the link from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive', which is 24.\nThis confirms that 24 patients went from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'.",
