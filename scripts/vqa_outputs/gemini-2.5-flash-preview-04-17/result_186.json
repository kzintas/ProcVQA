  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "49",
  "llm_answer": "49",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "I need to find the total number of rebounds shown in the diagram.\nI located the nodes labeled 'Rebound'. There are two such nodes.\nThe first 'Rebound' node is reached from 'Missed Shot'. The link leading to this 'Rebound' node has a value of 15. This indicates 15 sequences ended in a 'Rebound' after a 'Missed Shot'.\nThe second 'Rebound' node is reached from 'UMD Offense'. The link leading to this 'Rebound' node has a value of 34. This indicates 34 sequences ended in a 'Rebound' after 'UMD Offense'.\nTo find the total number of rebounds, I sum the counts entering these 'Rebound' nodes.\nTotal Rebounds = Count entering Rebound 1 + Count entering Rebound 2\nTotal Rebounds = 15 + 34 = 49.\nTherefore, the total number of rebounds shown in the diagram is 49.",
