I located the 'Emergency' node and the 'ICU' node in the diagram.\n4.  I found the directed link originating from 'Emergency' and ending at 'ICU'.\n5.  This link has a numeric label associated with it, which represents the number of sequences (patients) transitioning from 'Emergency' to 'ICU'.\n6.  The label on the link from 'Emergency' to 'ICU' is 62.\n7.  Therefore, 62 patients went to the ICU after Emergency according to the diagram.",
