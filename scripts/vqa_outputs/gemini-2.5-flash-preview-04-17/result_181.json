  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  Identify the target node: The question asks about events after 'UMD Offense'.\n2.  Examine the outgoing links from the 'UMD Offense' node: There are two outgoing links.\n3.  Identify the destination nodes of these links: One link goes to 'Rebound', and the other goes to '_Exit'.\n4.  Check if any of the outgoing links or subsequent nodes represent 'Steal': Neither 'Rebound' nor '_Exit' is labeled 'Steal'. There are no other nodes directly connected after 'UMD Offense'.\n5.  Conclusion: The diagram does not show any transition from 'UMD Offense' to a 'Steal' event, nor does it show a 'Steal' event occurring directly after 'UMD Offense' in any sequence. Therefore, the number of steals after 'UMD Offense' cannot be determined from this visualization.",
