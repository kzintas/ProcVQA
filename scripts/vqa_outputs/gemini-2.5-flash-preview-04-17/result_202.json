  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  I located the \"UMD Offense\" node in the diagram.\n2.  I examined the outgoing links from the \"UMD Offense\" node to see which events followed it.\n3.  The links from \"UMD Offense\" lead to nodes labeled \"Rebound\" (with a count of 34) and \"_Exit\" (with a count of 22).\n4.  I checked if any node labeled \"Steal\" is directly connected as a successor to \"UMD Offense\". None are.\n5.  I also followed the path from \"Rebound\", which leads to another \"_Exit\" node (with a count of 24). There is no \"Steal\" node in this subsequent path either.\n6.  The diagram explicitly shows all the transitions occurring after \"UMD Offense\" (\"Rebound\" and \"_Exit\"). A \"Steal\" event is not represented anywhere as following \"UMD Offense\" or any subsequent node shown.\n7.  Therefore, the number of steals after UMD Offense cannot be determined from the information provided in this visualization.",
