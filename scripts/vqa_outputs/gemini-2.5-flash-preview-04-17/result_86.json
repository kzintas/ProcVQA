  "full_response": "<reason>\nI have examined the node-link diagram.\nI am looking for nodes labeled 'Discharge-Alive'.\nI found two such nodes in the diagram.\nThe first 'Discharge-Alive' node is in the second main pathway column and has a count of 37. This pathway is _Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit.\nThe second 'Discharge-Alive' node is in the third main pathway column and has a count of 20. This pathway is _Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit.\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, I need to sum the counts associated with these 'Discharge-Alive' nodes.\nTotal discharged alive = Count from pathway 1 + Count from pathway 2\nTotal discharged alive = 37 + 20\nTotal discharged alive = 57.\n</reason>\n<answer>57</answer>",
