  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive.\nI need to locate all nodes in the diagram that represent patients being discharged alive.\nThese nodes are labeled 'Discharge-Alive'.\nI can see two instances of the 'Discharge-Alive' node in the diagram.\nThe first 'Discharge-Alive' node is in the second pathway from the left. It is preceded by 'Emergency' and has a count of 37.\nThe second 'Discharge-Alive' node is in the third pathway from the left. It is preceded by 'Floor' and has a count of 20.\nTo find the total number of patients discharged alive, I need to sum the counts associated with all 'Discharge-Alive' nodes.\nTotal discharged alive = Count for the first 'Discharge-Alive' node + Count for the second 'Discharge-Alive' node.\nTotal discharged alive = 37 + 20 = 57.",
