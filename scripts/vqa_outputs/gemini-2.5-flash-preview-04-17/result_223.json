  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of shots made *by* the UNC offense. This implies counting 'Made Shot' events that occur during a UNC offensive possession. In this diagram, an offensive possession for UNC starts with a 'UNC Offense' node and continues until a change in possession (like a turnover, rebound after a missed shot that leads to UMD offense, or the end of a sequence/exit) or a successful shot (Made Shot).\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n- In the first major sequence column (starting with 2), there is a path: `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Made Shot` (2). These 2 made shots occurred during a UNC possession.\n- In the second major sequence column (starting with 13), there is a path: `_Start` (13) -> `UNC Offense` (13) -> `Foul` (13) -> `Made Free Throw` (12). Made Free Throws are distinct from Made Shots in this visualization based on the labeling.\n- In the third major sequence column (starting with 26), there is a `Made Shot` node with a value of 9. The path leading to it is `Rebound` (17) -> `Made Shot` (9). Tracing further back, `Rebound` (17) comes from `UMD Offense` (20), which comes from `Missed Shot` (25), which comes from `Rebound` (26), which comes from `UNC Offense` (26). Since this `Made Shot` occurs *after* a `UMD Offense` node in the sequence, it is likely a UMD made shot, not a UNC made shot from that initial possession sequence.\n- In the fourth major sequence column (starting with 21), there is a path: `_Start` (21) -> `UNC Offense` (21) -> `Made Shot` (20). These 20 made shots occurred directly during a UNC possession.\n- In the fifth major sequence column (starting with 7), there is no `Made Shot` node.\n\nBased on tracing the paths that include a 'Made Shot' node and ensuring they originate from 'UNC Offense' without an intervening 'UMD Offense', the UNC made shots are:\n- The 2 made shots in the first column.\n- The 20 made shots in the fourth column.\n\nTotal made shots by UNC offense = 2 + 20 = 22.",
  "full_response": "1.  Identify all nodes labeled 'Made Shot'.\n2.  Trace the incoming links to these 'Made Shot' nodes to determine the preceding event.\n3.
