  "question": "How many patients went to the ICU after the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "24",
  "llm_answer": "24",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. The question asks for the number of patients who went from the \"Floor\" to the \"ICU\".\n2. I need to find directed links in the diagram where the source node is \"Floor\" and the target node is \"ICU\".\n3. I examined the diagram and located the nodes labeled \"Floor\" and \"ICU\".\n4. I looked for links connecting \"Floor\" to \"ICU\".\n5. I found one such link in the rightmost pathway column.\n6. This link originates from the \"Floor\" node and points to the \"ICU\" node below it.\n7. The numeric label next to this link indicates the number of sequences following this specific path segment.\n8. The numeric label associated with the link from \"Floor\" to \"ICU\" is 24.\n9. Therefore, 24 patients went to the ICU after the Floor according to this diagram.",
