  "reasoning": "The user is asking for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\nI need to examine the node-link diagram to find information related to \"free throws made\" by \"UMD Offense\".\nThe nodes are `_Start`, `UNC Offense`, `UMD Offense`, `Rebound`, and `_Exit`.\nThe links represent transitions between these events and are labeled with the number of sequences following that path.\nThe diagram shows sequences passing through `UMD Offense`, and then splitting to `Rebound` (34 sequences) or `_Exit` (35 sequences).\nThe diagram does not contain any node or link label that mentions \"free throws\" or any specific type of score or action within the UMD Offense phase.\nThe diagram only shows the overall flow of events and the number of sequences taking different paths after UMD Offense.\nTherefore, based solely on the information provided in the visualization, it is not possible to determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.",
