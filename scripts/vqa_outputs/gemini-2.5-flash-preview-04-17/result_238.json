There is a link from 'UNC Offense' to 'Jump Ball' with a count of 1.\nColumn 2: Starts with '_Start' (14), followed by 'UNC Offense' (14).

Links from 'UNC Offense' go to 'Rebound', 'Foul', and 'Made Free Throw'. No link to 'Jump Ball'.\nColumn 4: Starts with '_Start' (14), followed by 'UNC Offense' (14).
