  "question": "How many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense?",
  "true_answer": "22",
  "llm_answer": "22",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occurred in sequences where \"UNC Offense\" happened before the \"Made Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" happened after the \"Made Shot\". In the diagram, this corresponds to the number of sequences traversing the path \"UNC Offense\" -> \"Made Shot\" -> \"UMD Offense\". The diagram explicitly shows a link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" with a count of 22, and a link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" with a count of 22. This means that 22 sequences followed the path from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\", and these same 22 sequences continued from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". Thus, there were 22 instances where a \"Made Shot\" occurred immediately following \"UNC Offense\" and immediately preceding \"UMD Offense\". This fulfills the condition of \"after UNC Offense but before UMD offense\".",
  "full_response": "1.  Identify the nodes \"UNC Offense\", \"Made Shot\", and \"UMD Offense\".\n2.  Locate the link connecting \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\". The count on this link is 22. This means 22 sequences of events started with \"UNC Offense\" and immediately went to \"Made Shot\".\n3.  Locate the link connecting \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\". The count on this link is 22. This means 22 sequences of events that reached \"Made Shot\" then went to \"UMD Offense\".\n4.  The structure of the diagram shows that the sequences flowing from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" (count 22) are the same sequences that then flow from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\" (count 22).\n5.  Therefore, the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occurred after \"UNC Offense\" and before \"UMD Offense\" is represented by the count on the link from \"UNC Offense\" to \"Made Shot\" and the count on the link from \"Made Shot\" to \"UMD Offense\", both of which are 22.\n\n<reasoning>The question asks for the number of \"Made Shot\" events that occurred in sequences where \"UNC Offense\" happened before the \"Made Shot\" and \"UMD Offense\" happened after the \"Made Shot\".
