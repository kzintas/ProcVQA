  "full_response": "<reasoning>I examined the node-link diagram column by column, tracing the pathways to look for sequences involving \"UMD Offense\" followed by \"Made Free Throw\".\n\nColumn 1: The path is _Start -> UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot or _Exit. No \"Made Free Throw\" after \"UMD Offense\".\nColumn 2: The path is _Start -> UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense -> Rebound -> Made Shot or _Exit. No \"Made Free Throw\" after \"UMD Offense\".\nColumn 3: The path is _Start -> UNC Offense -> ... -> UMD Offense. From UMD Offense, there are no outgoing links shown. No \"Made Free Throw\" after \"UMD Offense\".\nColumn 4: The path is _Start -> UNC Offense -> Foul -> Made Free Throw -> Made Free Throw or UMD Offense. This shows UNC Offense leading to Made Free Throw, followed by UMD Offense. No \"Made Free Throw\" after \"UMD Offense\".\nColumn 5: The path is _Start -> UNC Offense -> Foul -> Made Free Throw -> Made Free Throw or UMD Offense. This shows UNC Offense leading to Made Free Throw, followed by UMD Offense. No \"Made Free Throw\" after \"UMD Offense\".\nColumn 6: The path is _Start -> UNC Offense -> Made Shot or UMD Offense. From UMD Offense, the path leads to Missed Shot. No \"Made Free Throw\" after \"UMD Offense\".\n\nIn all observed sequences, there is no link originating from the \"UMD Offense\" node that leads directly to a \"Made Free Throw\" node. The \"Made Free Throw\" nodes appear after fouls initiated by \"UNC Offense\" and are sometimes followed by \"UMD Offense\", implying UMD gained possession after UNC made a free throw. The visualization does not depict UMD Offense successfully making a free throw. Therefore, the number of free throws made by UMD Offense cannot be determined from the provided diagram. If the number was zero, there would ideally be a link from UMD Offense to an _Exit or another node without going through Made Free Throw for all sequences starting with UMD Offense that could potentially have a free throw. However, the absence of the specific sequence 'UMD Offense' -> 'Made Free Throw' means this event sequence is not represented in the diagram, making the number of free throws made by UMD Offense indeterminate based on the information provided. It's possible this event didn't occur in the observed sequences, or it's not included in the visualization. Given the instruction to answer *solely* based on what is explicitly shown, and the sequence isn't shown, the answer is indeterminate.<answer>indeterminate</answer>",
