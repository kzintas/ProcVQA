  "reasoning": "The user wants to know the total number of shots made by the UNC offense.\nI need to identify all nodes labeled \"Made Shot\" in the diagram and trace back their origin to see if they followed a path originating from \"UNC Offense\".\n\n1.  Examine each column starting from a `_Start` node that flows into `UNC Offense`.\n2.  Trace the paths from `UNC Offense` nodes.\n3.  Identify links that end at a `Made Shot` node.\n4.  Sum the counts on these links, ensuring the path originates from `UNC Offense` and does not pass through `UMD Offense`.\n\nColumn 1:\n-   `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Made Shot` (2). This path results in 2 made shots by UNC offense.\n\nColumn 2:\n-   `_Start` (19) -> `UNC Offense` (19) -> `Rebound` (19) -> `Missed Shot` (19) -> `UMD Offense` (17) -> `Rebound` (15) -> `Made Shot` (8). This path goes through `UMD Offense` before reaching `Made Shot`. These 8 shots are made by the UMD offense, not UNC offense.\n\nColumn 3:\n-   `_Start` (12) -> `UNC Offense` (12) -> `Foul` (12) -> `Made Free Throw` (11). This path leads to a `Made Free Throw`, not a `Made Shot`. While a free throw is a type of shot, the diagram uses the distinct label \"Made Shot\". Based on a strict interpretation of the explicit labels, I will only count nodes labeled \"Made Shot\".\n\nColumn 4:\n-   `_Start` (8) -> `UNC Offense` (8) -> `Turnover` (5) or `UMD Offense` (7). No `Made Shot` node is reached from the `UNC Offense` node in this column.\n\nColumn 5:\n-   `_Start` (28) -> `UNC Offense` (28) -> `Made Shot` (20). This path results in 20 made shots by UNC offense.\n-   `_Start` (28) -> `UNC Offense` (28) -> `UMD Offense` (25). No `Made Shot` node is directly reached from the `UNC Offense` node along this specific link.\n\nSumming the counts on the links ending in `Made Shot` that originate from `UNC Offense` paths:\n-   From Column 1: 2\n-   From Column 5: 20\n\nTotal = 2 + 20 = 22.\n\nI am interpreting \"shots\" as referring specifically to the event labeled \"Made Shot\" in the diagram, as there is a separate label for \"Made Free Throw\". This is based on using the explicit labels provided in the visualization. The phrase \"by only the UNC offense\" excludes shots made following a UMD Offense sequence. The identified Made Shot nodes (2 in Col 1, 20 in Col 5) occur directly after a UNC Offense state in the sequence flow shown by the links. The Made Shot node (8 in Col 2) clearly follows a UMD Offense state.\n\nTherefore, the total number of shots labeled \"Made Shot\" that originated from UNC offense sequences is 22.",
