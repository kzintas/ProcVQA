  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "20",
  "llm_answer": "20",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The user wants to know the total number of patients who were discharged alive after having been to the 'Floor' node.\nI need to look for sequences in the diagram that contain the node 'Floor' followed by the node 'Discharge-Alive'.\nExamining the different columns/pathways presented in the diagram:\n- The first column shows a sequence ending in 'Die'. It does not contain 'Floor'.\n- The second column shows a sequence ending in 'Discharge-Alive' directly from 'Emergency'. It does not contain 'Floor'.\n- The third column shows a sequence: _Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> ICU -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit. The number of sequences following the path from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive' is explicitly shown as 20. This fits the criteria (going to Floor, then being discharged alive).\n- The fourth column shows a sequence: _Start -> Arrival -> Emergency -> Floor -> ICU -> Die -> _Exit. This sequence goes through 'Floor' but ends in 'Die', not 'Discharge-Alive'.\n\nTherefore, the only pathway that goes through 'Floor' and subsequently to 'Discharge-Alive' is the one in the third column, which accounts for 20 patients.\n\nI sum up the counts on all links going from 'Floor' to 'Discharge-Alive'. There is only one such link, with a count of 20.",
