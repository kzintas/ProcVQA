  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The question asks for the number of patients who went from the 'ICU' node to the 'Floor' node.\nI need to identify the link connecting the 'ICU' node to the 'Floor' node in the diagram.\nStarting from the 'Emergency' node, there are two outgoing links: one goes to 'ICU' with a count of 62, and the other goes to 'Discharge-Alive' with a count of 38. The total is 62 + 38 = 100, which matches the incoming count to 'Emergency'.\nFrom the 'ICU' node, there are three outgoing links: one to 'Die' with a count of 36, one to 'Floor' with a count of 24, and one to '_Exit' with a count of 2. The sum of these counts is 36 + 24 + 2 = 62, which matches the incoming count to 'ICU' from 'Emergency'.\nThe link from 'ICU' to 'Floor' has the label '24'. This indicates that 24 sequences followed this path.",
