  "question": "How many total rebounds are there in the match?",
  "true_answer": "34",
  "llm_answer": "34",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1. Identify the node representing 'Rebound'. The node labeled \"Rebound\" is located in the lower part of the diagram.\n2. Identify the link(s) leading into the 'Rebound' node. There is one directed link pointing from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\".\n3. Read the numerical label associated with this incoming link. The link from \"UMD Offense\" to \"Rebound\" has a label of 34.\n4. Understand what this number represents in the context of the diagram. The number on a link indicates the count of sequences that follow that specific transition. Therefore, 34 sequences transitioned from the \"UMD Offense\" state to the \"Rebound\" state. This means the 'Rebound' event occurred 34 times in these sequences, happening after a UMD Offense.\n5. Determine if there are any other links leading to the 'Rebound' node. There are no other incoming links to the \"Rebound\" node.\n6. Based on the diagram, the total number of times the 'Rebound' event occurs is the sum of the counts of all incoming links. Since there is only one incoming link with a count of 34, the total number of rebounds shown in the diagram is 34.\n7. The question asks for the total number of rebounds in the match, based on the diagram. The diagram shows 34 instances of the 'Rebound' event. Assuming the diagram accurately represents all rebounds in the sequences shown, the total number of rebounds is 34.",
