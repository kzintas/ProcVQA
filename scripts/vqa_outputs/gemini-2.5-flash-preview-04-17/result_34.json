  "question": "How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?",
  "true_answer": "indeterminate",
  "llm_answer": "indeterminate",
  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "1.  Identify the goal: Determine the number of patients discharged alive after going to the 'Floor'.\n2.  Examine the node-link diagram: Look for nodes representing events and links representing transitions.\n3.  Locate the 'Floor' node: Scan the diagram for a node labeled 'Floor'.\n4.  Observe the nodes present: The nodes are `_Start`, `Arrival`, `Emergency`, `ICU`, `Die`, `_Exit`, and `Discharge-Alive`.\n5.  Determine if 'Floor' is present: The node labeled 'Floor' is not present in the diagram.\n6.  Evaluate if the question can be answered: Since the event 'Floor' is not represented in the visualization, it is impossible to determine the number of patients who went to the 'Floor' and subsequently were discharged alive based *solely* on this diagram.\n7.  Conclusion: The information needed to answer the question is not available in the provided visualization.",
