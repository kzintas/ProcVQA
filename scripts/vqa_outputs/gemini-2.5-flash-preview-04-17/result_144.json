  "is_correct": true,
  "reasoning": "The user is asking for the number of free throws made by UMD Offense.\nI need to examine the node-link diagram to see if it contains information about free throws.\nThe diagram shows the sequence of events starting from '_Start'.\nThe path goes through 'UNC Offense' and then 'UMD Offense'.\nFrom 'UMD Offense', there are three paths: to 'Rebound' (34 sequences), to 'Missed Shot' (14 sequences), and to '_Exit' (21 sequences).\nThe 'Rebound' node is followed by 'Made Shot' (15 sequences) and '_Exit' (19 sequences).\nThe 'Made Shot' node is followed by '_Exit' (15 sequences).\nThe 'Missed Shot' node is followed by '_Exit' (14 sequences).\nThe diagram indicates that 15 sequences resulted in a 'Made Shot', but this event happens after a 'Rebound', which is unusual for a free throw sequence. More importantly, the diagram does not distinguish between different types of made shots (e.g., field goals vs. free throws).\nThere is no node or link labeled 'Free Throw' anywhere in the diagram.\nTherefore, the number of free throws made by UMD Offense cannot be determined from the information provided in the visualization.",
