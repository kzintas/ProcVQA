  "question": "How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?",
  "true_answer": "21",

  "reasoning": "No reasoning found",
  "full_response": "<reason>\nThe user is asking for the total count of \"Missed Shot\" events that occur in sequences starting with \"UNC Offense\" and happening before a \"UMD Offense\" event within the same sequence path.\n\nI will examine each sequence pathway starting from \"UNC Offense\" and identify \"Missed Shot\" nodes. For each \"Missed Shot\" node found, I will check if it appears *before* any \"UMD Offense\" node in that specific sequence branch. I will sum the counts of all such \"Missed Shot\" nodes.\n\n1.  **Column 1:** Starts with UNC Offense (7).\n    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (7) -> Missed Shot (7). This Missed Shot node is before the UMD Offense (7) node further down in the sequence. Count = 7.\n    -   Pathway continues: Missed Shot (7) -> UMD Offense (7). The Missed Shot occurred before this UMD Offense.\n2.  **Column 2:** Starts with UNC Offense (14).\n    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (14) -> Rebound (14) -> Missed Shot (14). This Missed Shot node is before the UMD Offense (13) node branching from the Missed Shot node. Count = 14.\n    -   Pathway continues: Missed Shot (14) -> UMD Offense (13). The Missed Shot occurred before this UMD Offense.\n3.  **Column 3:** Starts with UNC Offense (4).\n    -   Pathways include Rebound, Turnover, UMD Offense, Steal. No Missed Shot node is present after UNC Offense in this column. Count = 0.\n4.  **Column 4:** Starts with UNC Offense (4).\n    -   Pathways include Jump Ball, Foul -> _Exit. No Missed Shot node is present after UNC Offense in this column. Count = 0.\n5.  **Column 5:** Starts with UNC Offense (15).\n    -   Pathways include Foul -> Made Free Throw -> Made Free Throw -> UMD Offense, or Foul -> Made Free Throw -> _Exit, or Foul -> _Exit. No Missed Shot node is present after UNC Offense in this column. Count = 0.\n6.  **Column 6:** Starts with UNC Offense (25).\n    -   Pathways include Made Shot, UMD Offense, Missed Shot.\n    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (25) -> Missed Shot (15). This Missed Shot node is after UNC Offense (25). There is a UMD Offense (23) node branching from the same UNC Offense node, but the Missed Shot occurred before reaching that branch's UMD Offense node. Count = 15.\n    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (25) -> UMD Offense (23). This path goes directly to UMD Offense.\n    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (25) -> Made Shot (21). No Missed Shot.\n\nNow, I sum the counts of Missed Shot nodes identified that occurred after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense in their path: 7 (from Column 1) + 14 (from Column 2) + 15 (from Column 6) = 36.\n</reason>\n<answer>36</answer>",
