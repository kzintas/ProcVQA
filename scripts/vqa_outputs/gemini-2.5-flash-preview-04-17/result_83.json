  "reasoning": "The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive *after* going to the Floor.\nI need to find the pathways in the diagram that include the node \"Floor\" followed by the node \"Discharge-Alive\".\nLooking at the diagram, I can trace pathways:\n1.  \\_Start -> Arrival (12) -> Emergency (12) -> ICU (12) -> Die (12) -> \\_Exit (12)\n2.  \\_Start -> Arrival (37) -> Emergency (37) -> Discharge-Alive (37) -> \\_Exit (37)\n3.  \\_Start -> Arrival (24) -> Emergency (24) -> ICU (23) -> Floor (23) -> Discharge-Alive (20) -> \\_Exit (24)\n    *   Note: There's also a path from Floor (23) to \\_Exit (23), but the Discharge-Alive node is before the \\_Exit node on the path from Floor. The links coming out of Floor are to Discharge-Alive (20) and to \\_Exit (not explicitly shown from Floor, but implied by the difference between the total reaching Floor and the number going to Discharge-Alive, which should exit at some point).
