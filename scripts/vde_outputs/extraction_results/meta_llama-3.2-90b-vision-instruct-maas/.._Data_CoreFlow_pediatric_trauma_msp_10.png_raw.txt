The image shows a node-link diagram with various nodes and links. The nodes are labeled with different words, and the links are labeled with numbers. To extract the connections as triplets, we need to identify the source node label, target node label, and the count value shown on each link.

Here are the extracted connections as triplets:

[["_Start", "breathing", 214], ["_Start", "pulse", 209], ["_Start", "pupil", 199], ["breathing", "_Exit", 5], ["pulse", "_Exit", 10], ["pupil", "_Exit", 23], ["pupil", "temp", 15], ["temp", "_Exit", 23], ["blanket", "iv", 57], ["blanket", "_Exit", 27], ["iv", "temp", 77], ["iv", "_Exit", 27], ["temp", "_Exit", 30]]

Note that some of the links have the same source and target node labels, but different count values. These are represented as separate triplets in the output.
