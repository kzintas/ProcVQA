q_28,./Data/CoreFlow/emergency_dataset/msp_25.png,6,How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,38,No reasoning found,"### Reasoning:
To determine the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, we need to follow the pathway from the start to the ""Discharge-Alive"" node.

1. From the start, 100 patients go to ""Arrival"".
2. From ""Arrival"", 100 patients go to ""Emergency"".
3. From ""Emergency"", 62 patients go to ""ICU"" and 38 patients go to ""Discharge-Alive"".

The pathway to ""Discharge-Alive"" is directly from ""Emergency"" without passing through ""ICU"". Therefore, the number of patients discharged alive is the sum of those who went directly from ""Emergency"" to ""Discharge-Alive"".

### Calculation:
- Number of patients from ""Emergency"" to ""Discharge-Alive"": 38

Thus, the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is 38.

q_37,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,3,How many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emrgency?,Detect Antecedent Sequealea,38,71,No reasoning found,"### Reasoning:
To determine how many patients were discharged alive directly after an Emergency, we need to follow the pathway from ""Emergency"" to ""Discharge-Alive"". 

1. From the ""Emergency"" node, there are two paths leading out: one to ""Floor"" and another to ""ICU"".
2. The link width between ""Emergency"" and ""Floor"" is 21, indicating 21 patients went to the Floor.
3. The link width between ""Emergency"" and ""ICU"" is 41, indicating 41 patients went to the ICU.
4. From the ""Floor"" node, there is a link to ""Discharge-Alive"" with a width of 38, indicating 38 patients were discharged alive from the Floor.
5. From the ""ICU"" node, there is no direct link to ""Discharge-Alive"", but we can infer that the remaining patients from the ""ICU"" node (41 - 8 = 33) would also be discharged alive since there's no other exit.

Adding these together, the total number of patients discharged alive directly after an Emergency is the sum of those going to the Floor and those going to the ICU:

- Patients from ""Floor"": 38
- Patients from ""ICU"": 33

Total = 38 + 33 = 71

- The node labeled ""Start"" has 69 sequences leading to it.
- From ""Start,"" there's a link to ""UNC Offense"" with 69 sequences.
- From ""Start,"" there's also a link to ""UMD Offense"" with 69 sequences.
- From ""UMD Offense,"" there are two paths: one to ""Rebound"" with 34 sequences and another to ""_Exit"" with 35 sequences.

### Reasoning:
1. The total number of sequences starting at ""Start"" is 69.
2. These 69 sequences split into two paths: one for ""UNC Offense"" and one for ""UMD Offense.""
3. Since the total number of sequences from ""Start"" is 69 and they split equally between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense,"" each path must have 34.5 sequences. However, since we cannot have half a sequence, this suggests an error in the interpretation or the data provided might not be accurate for a real-world scenario but for the purpose of this exercise, we'll consider the given numbers.
4. The question asks specifically about the ""shots made"" by ""UMD Offense."" In the context of the diagram, ""Rebound"" and ""_Exit"" represent different outcomes after the ""UMD Offense"" stage. ""Rebound"" implies a missed shot, while ""_Exit"" implies a successful shot.
5. Therefore, the number of ""shots made"" by ""UMD Offense"" would be the number of sequences leading to ""_Exit,"" which is 35.

- The node labeled ""Jump Ball"" is present.
- There is a link from ""_Start"" to ""UNC Offense"".
- The link width between ""_Start"" and ""UNC Offense"" is 19.

### Thought Process:
1. Identify the starting point of the sequence, which is ""_Start"".
2. Follow the pathway from ""_Start"" to ""UNC Offense"".
3. Check if there is any link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Jump Ball"".
4. The link width between ""_Start"" and ""UNC Offense"" is given as 19, indicating the number of sequences that follow this path.

### Reasoning:
The link width between ""_Start"" and ""UNC Offense"" is 19, which means there were 19 sequences where the game started with UNC Offense. However, the diagram does not show a direct link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Jump Ball"". Therefore, we cannot determine the number of times a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense based on the provided data.

q_231,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_25.png,1,How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?,Detect Antecedent Sequealea,1,0,No reasoning found,"### Reasoning
To determine how many times a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the node labeled ""Jump Ball"" in the diagram.
2. Trace the pathway from the ""Start"" node to the ""Jump Ball"" node.
3. Check if there is a link from the ""UNC Offense"" node to the ""Jump Ball"" node.
4. If there is a link, note its width and the label indicating the count.

From the diagram:
- There is a link from ""Start"" to ""Jump Ball"" with a count of 19.
- There is no direct link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Jump Ball"".

Since there is no direct link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Jump Ball"", it means a jump ball did not occur after UNC Offense.

q_232,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_25.png,2,How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?,Summing Weights,19,0,No reasoning found,"### Reasoning:
To determine the total number of missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes labeled ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense.""
2. Look for any nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"" that are directly connected to ""UNC Offense"" and lead to ""UMD Offense.""
3. Sum the counts of these ""Missed Shot"" nodes.

From the diagram:
- There is one link from ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound,"" which is not relevant to our query.
- There is another link from ""Missed Shot"" to ""Made Free Throw,"" which is also not relevant to our query.
- There is no direct link from ""Missed Shot"" to ""UMD Offense.""

Since there are no direct transitions from ""Missed Shot"" to ""UMD Offense,"" the count of missed shots occurring after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense is zero.

q_234,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_25.png,4,How many total made shots were made by both teams?,Summing Weights,30,22,No reasoning found,"### Reasoning:
To determine the total number of made shots made by both teams, we need to sum up the made shots for each team as indicated by the labels.

1. For UNC Offense:
   - Made Shot: 2

2. For UMD Offense:
   - Made Shot: 20

Adding these together gives us the total number of made shots:

Total Made Shots = Made Shot (UNC Offense) + Made Shot (UMD Offense)
                  = 2 + 20
                  = 22
