<reasoning>
To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to look at the pathways from UMD Offense. The diagram shows that UMD Offense leads to two main paths: one leading to Rebound and another leading to Missed Shot.

From UMD Offense:
- There is a link labeled ""10"" leading to Missed Shot.
- There is no direct link labeled ""Rebound"" from UMD Offense.

Since there are 69 sequences starting from Start, and 10 of those sequences lead directly to Missed Shot without going through Rebound, the number of times UMD Offense does not transition to a Rebound is 69 - 10 = 59.

However, since the question asks for the number of times it did not transition to a Rebound, and considering the diagram only shows transitions, the correct interpretation is that all 69 sequences start with UMD Offense and then either go to Missed Shot or some other event (like Foul or Turnover).

## Reasoning
To determine how many times UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound, we need to look at the pathways from UMD Offense. The diagram shows two paths diverging from UMD Offense: one leading to Rebound and another leading to Missed Shot.

- The path to Rebound has a label of 34.
- The path to Missed Shot has a label of 14.

Since there are 69 sequences starting with UMD Offense (as indicated by the vertical bar), we can calculate the number of sequences that did not transition to a Rebound by subtracting the number of sequences that did transition to a Rebound from the total sequences:

\[ \text{Total Sequences} - \text{Sequences to Rebound} = 69 - 34 = 35 \]

Therefore, 35 times out of the 69 sequences starting with UMD Offense did not transition to a Rebound."

1. Start at UMD Offense.
2. Follow the link labeled ""Rebound"" which leads to a node labeled ""Rebound"".
3. The numeric label next to this link is 8, indicating that there are 8 sequences following this path.

Therefore, the number of rebounds made after UMD Offense is 8.

To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to count all the nodes labeled ""Rebound"" and their corresponding link labels.

1. Start at the node labeled ""Start.""
2. Follow the path to the first ""Rebound"" node.
3. The link label next to this ""Rebound"" node is 22.
4. Continue following the path from the ""Rebound"" node to the next event.
5. The next event is ""Made Shot,"" which has a link label of 22.
6. From the ""Made Shot"" node, follow the path to the next ""Rebound"" node.
7. The link label next to this ""Rebound"" node is 23.
8. Finally, follow the path from the last ""Rebound"" node to the ""Exit"" node.
9. The link label next to this ""Exit"" node is 15.

Adding up all the link labels for the ""Rebound"" nodes: 22 + 22 + 23 + 15 = 82.

However, it seems there might be an error in the diagram as the total number of rebounds should not exceed the number of events (which is 69). Let's re-examine the diagram carefully:

- There are 69 events in total.
- The sum of the link labels for the ""Rebound"" nodes is 82, which exceeds the total number of events.

To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathway from ""Start"" to ""Made Free Throw"" for UMD Offense.

2. Rebound: 7
3. Missed Shot: 6

- One path goes through ""Rebound"" and ""Missed Shot"", then directly to ""Made Free Throw"".
- The other path goes through ""Rebound"" and ""Made Shot"", then directly to ""Made Free Throw"".

q_214,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_10.png,5,How many total missed shots were made by both teams?,Summing Weights,34,21,No reasoning found,"<answer>21</answer>

<reasoning>
To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to count all instances where a ""Missed Shot"" event occurs. 

From the diagram:
- There are 7 instances of ""Missed Shot"" for UNC.
- There are 6 instances of ""Missed Shot"" for UMD.

Adding these together: 
7 (UNC) + 6 (UMD) = 13

However, there is an additional instance of ""Missed Shot"" that appears twice in the diagram, which means it should be counted once more. Therefore, the total number of missed shots is:

13 (initial count) + 1 (additional instance) = 14

Since there is another instance of ""Missed Shot"" that appears twice, we add one more to the initial count of 14:

14 + 1 = 15

But this still does not match the provided answer of 21. Upon re-examining the diagram, it appears there might be an error in the interpretation or labeling of the nodes. The correct approach would be to sum the instances of ""Missed Shot"" directly from the diagram without adding any extra counts. 

Therefore, the correct total number of missed shots made by both teams is:

13 (UNC) + 6 (UMD) = 19

However, since the provided answer is 21 and there seems to be an inconsistency in the diagram's representation, I will conclude with the calculated value of 19 as the best estimate based on the given data."

To determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to identify all nodes labeled ""Made Shot"" and count them. We also need to ensure that these nodes are connected exclusively through links originating from nodes labeled ""UNC Offense.""

## Reasoning
To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to follow the pathway from ""Start"" to ""Made Free Throw"" for UMD Offense. 

1. Start: The first node is ""Start"".
2. Next, we look for the link leading from ""Start"" to ""UMD Offense"". This link has a label of 8, indicating that there are 8 sequences starting with UMD Offense.
3. Following the link from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Made Free Throw"", we find that this link has a label of 6.

Since the label next to the link between ""UMD Offense"" and ""Made Free Throw"" is 6, it indicates that in 6 out of the 8 sequences where UMD Offense occurs, a free throw was made. Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is 6."

## Reasoning
To determine the number of shots made by only the UNC offense, we need to identify all nodes labeled ""Made Shot"" and filter out those that are not connected to a node labeled ""UNC Offense."" 

1. Look at the ""Made Shot"" nodes in the diagram.
2. Identify which ""Made Shot"" nodes have no connection to any other event except ""UNC Offense.""
3. Count these isolated ""Made Shot"" nodes.

From the diagram:
- There are 7 ""Made Shot"" nodes with connections to ""UNC Offense.""
- There are 7 ""Made Shot"" nodes without any connections to other events.

Therefore, there are 7 shots made by only the UNC offense."
