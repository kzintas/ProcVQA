The only pathway from ""UNC Offense"" goes through other events like ""Rebound"" and ""Missed Shot"" before reaching an exit or another event.","To determine how many times a jump ball occurred after UNC Offense, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the node labeled ""UNC Offense"" and trace all paths leading from it.
2. Look for any path that leads directly to a node labeled ""Jump Ball.""

From the visualization:
- There is one instance of ""UNC Offense"" at the top with a value of 19.
- From this ""UNC Offense,"" there are multiple pathways, but none of them lead directly to ""Jump Ball.""

Since there is no direct link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Jump Ball,"" we can conclude that a jump ball did not occur immediately after UNC Offense.

<reasoning>

Summing these values gives the total number of missed shots.","To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, I'll identify all nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"" and sum their corresponding values:

1. There are two ""Missed Shot"" nodes in the diagram.
2. The first ""Missed Shot"" node has a value of 19.
3. The second ""Missed Shot"" node has a value of 18.

Summing these values:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

<reasoning>
The diagram shows two ""Missed Shot"" nodes with values 19 and 18. Summing these values gives the total number of missed shots.

- There is no direct link from ""UMD Offense"" to a ""Made Shot"" node.
- Therefore, based on the given visualization, there are no sequences where UMD Offense directly leads to a made shot, which would typically represent a successful free throw.","To determine the number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we need to identify the relevant pathways in the node-link diagram:

1. Locate the ""UMD Offense"" node.
2. Follow the links from this node to see if there is a direct path to a ""Made Shot"" node that could represent a free throw.

<reasoning>
- The ""UMD Offense"" node has two outgoing links: one leading to ""Missed Shot"" (18 sequences) and another leading to ""Exit"" (15 sequences).
- There is no direct link from ""UMD Offense"" to a ""Made Shot"" node.
- Therefore, based on the given visualization, there are no sequences where UMD Offense directly leads to a made shot, which would typically represent a successful free throw.

We sum the counts of direct paths (33 + 15) and the indirect path via ""Rebound"" (7).","To determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense, we need to identify all pathways that start with ""UNC Offense"" and end with ""Made Shot"" without passing through any other ""UMD Offense"" nodes.

1. Starting from the top left ""UNC Offense"" node:
   - There are 19 sequences leading directly to a ""Rebound"".
   - From this ""Rebound"", 7 sequences lead to a ""Made Shot"".

2. Moving to the middle ""UNC Offense"" node:
   - There are 33 sequences leading directly to a ""Made Shot"".

3. Finally, for the top right ""UNC Offense"" node:
   - All 15 sequences lead directly to a ""Made Shot"".

Summing these up:
- Directly from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Made Shot"": 33 + 15 = 48
- Indirect via ""Rebound"": 7

Adding these together gives us the total number of shots made by only the UNC offense.

<reasoning>
The relevant pathways are those starting at ""UNC Offense"" and ending at ""Made Shot"". We sum the counts of direct paths (33 + 15) and the indirect path via ""Rebound"" (7).

1. Start at the top node labeled ""UNC Offense"".
2. Follow the pathway where ""UNC Offense"" leads directly to ""Made Shot"".

From the diagram:
- There are 20 sequences where ""UNC Offense"" directly leads to ""Made Shot"".

<reasoning>
The relevant pathway starts from ""UNC Offense"" and goes directly to ""Made Shot"" with a count of 20. This indicates that there are 20 sequences where the UNC offense makes a shot without any UMD offense intervening.
