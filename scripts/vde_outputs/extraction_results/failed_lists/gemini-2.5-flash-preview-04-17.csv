2.  Identify the event type we are looking for: ""Made Shot"".
3.  Identify the condition on the subsequent event: it must occur *before* ""UMD Offense"". In the context of this diagram, this means the path does not lead to the ""UMD Offense"" node after the ""Made Shot"" event.
4.  Trace the outgoing paths from ""UNC Offense"" that eventually lead to a ""Made Shot"" node.
    *   Path 1: ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Rebound"" (23 sequences) -> ""Made Shot"" (4 sequences). This ""Made Shot"" node leads to ""_Exit"". This fits the criteria (after UNC Offense, before UMD Offense). The number of sequences is 4.
    *   Path 2: ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Missed Shot"" (15 sequences) -> ""Rebound"" (9 sequences) -> ""Made Shot"" (7 sequences). This ""Made Shot"" node leads to ""_Exit"". This fits the criteria (after UNC Offense, before UMD Offense). The number of sequences is 7.
    *   Path 3: ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Foul"" (8 sequences) -> ""Made Free Throw"" (5 sequences) -> subsequent events are ""Turnover"" or another ""Made Free Throw"", eventually leading to ""UMD Offense"" or other outcomes not relevant to ""Made Shot"".
    *   Path 4: ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Turnover"" (24 sequences) -> ""UMD Offense"".
    *   Path 5: ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Made Free Throw"" (4 sequences) -> ""UMD Offense"".
5.  The only paths showing a ""Made Shot"" after ""UNC Offense"" that do not then proceed to ""UMD Offense"" are the two identified: ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Rebound"" -> ""Made Shot"" (4 sequences) and ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Missed Shot"" -> ""Rebound"" -> ""Made Shot"" (7 sequences).
6.  Sum the number of sequences for these identified paths: 4 + 7 = 11.
7.  Confirm that these sequences originate from ""UNC Offense"" and the ""Made Shot"" event is followed by ""_Exit"", meaning they do not continue to ""UMD Offense"". This is correct based on the diagram. The question asks for the number of *made shots* that fit the criteria, which corresponds to the flow count on the links leading to the ""Made Shot"" nodes in these specific sequences.

q_169,./Data/SentenTree/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_10.png,2,How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?,Summing Weights,69,68,"The question asks how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense.
I need to examine the links in the diagram that originate from the ""UNC Offense"" node or nodes that are direct successors of ""UNC Offense"", and terminate at the ""UMD Offense"" node.
The diagram shows several paths leading from the ""UNC Offense"" state to the ""UMD Offense"" state. These paths represent sequences of events.
1.  There is a direct link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"" with a count of 15. This represents 15 sequences where the transition happened immediately after the UNC Offense possession phase, without an intermediate event like a shot, rebound, or foul being explicitly labeled as the transition point.
2.  Sequences can go from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Made Shot"" (22 sequences), and then from ""Made Shot"" to ""UMD Offense"" (22 sequences). This represents 22 times UMD Offense possession started after a UNC Made Shot.
3.  Sequences can go from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Missed Shot"" (15 sequences), and then from ""Missed Shot"" to ""UMD Offense"" (15 sequences). This represents 15 times UMD Offense possession started after a UNC Missed Shot.
4.  Sequences can go from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Rebound"" (9 sequences), and then from ""Rebound"" to ""UMD Offense"" (8 sequences). This represents 8 times UMD Offense possession started after a UNC Rebound. (Note: The diagram shows Rebound also receives 8 from UMD Offense, but the 9 from UNC Offense are distinct sequences arriving at Rebound from that path).
5.  Sequences can go from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Foul"" (8 sequences), and then from ""Foul"" to ""UMD Offense"" (8 sequences). This represents 8 times UMD Offense possession started after a UNC Foul.

To find the total number of times UMD Offense transitioned *from* UNC Offense, I need to sum the counts of all sequences that started with UNC Offense and resulted in UMD Offense becoming the current state, either directly or through the intermediate events shown. In the diagram, this corresponds to summing the counts on all incoming links to the ""UMD Offense"" node that originate from ""UNC Offense"" or nodes that directly followed ""UNC Offense"".

The links pointing into ""UMD Offense"" are:
-   From ""UNC Offense"": 15
-   From ""Made Shot"": 22
-   From ""Missed Shot"": 15
-   From ""Rebound"": 8
-   From ""Foul"": 8

All these preceding nodes (""UNC Offense"", ""Made Shot"", ""Missed Shot"", ""Rebound"", ""Foul"") are states or events that immediately followed the initial ""UNC Offense"" state for the sequences depicted. Therefore, summing the counts on these incoming links to ""UMD Offense"" gives the total number of times a UNC Offense possession sequence led to a UMD Offense possession sequence.

Total count = 15 (direct) + 22 (via Made Shot) + 15 (via Missed Shot) + 8 (via Rebound) + 8 (via Foul) = 68.

This sum represents the total number of sequences that arrive at the 'UMD Offense' node, having originated from the 'UNC Offense' phase. Despite potential inconsistencies in flow conservation at other nodes, the counts on the links leading into 'UMD Offense' are explicitly given and represent the number of sequences taking those paths to reach the 'UMD Offense' state.

q_172,./Data/SentenTree/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_10.png,5,How many total rebounds are there in the match?,Summing Weights,49,32,No reasoning found,"<reason>
The user wants to find the total number of rebounds shown in the node-link diagram.
To answer this, I need to identify all nodes labeled ""Rebound"" and sum the counts of sequences that flow into these nodes, as indicated by the numbers on the incoming links.
There are two nodes labeled ""Rebound"" in the diagram.
1.  **Top ""Rebound"" node:** This node has two incoming links.
    *   A link from ""UNC Offense"" with a count of 9.
    *   A link from ""Missed Shot"" (which originates from ""UNC Offense"") with a count of 15.
    The total number of sequences entering the top ""Rebound"" node is 9 + 15 = 24. These represent 24 sequences where a rebound occurred at this stage.
2.  **Bottom ""Rebound"" node:** This node has one incoming link.
    *   A link from ""UMD Offense"" with a count of 8.
    This represents 8 sequences where a rebound occurred at this stage.

The total number of rebounds is the sum of the sequences entering all ""Rebound"" nodes.
Total Rebounds = (Sequences entering top ""Rebound"") + (Sequences entering bottom ""Rebound"")
Total Rebounds = 24 + 8
Total Rebounds = 32.

The sum of incoming links to the ""Rebound"" nodes provides the count of how many sequences reached the ""Rebound"" state.
Incoming links to top Rebound: 9 + 15 = 24
Incoming links to bottom Rebound: 8
Total: 24 + 8 = 32.

The outgoing links from the top Rebound sum to 8 (to UMD Offense) + 8 (to Foul) = 16. This sum (16) is not equal to the incoming sum (24). This discrepancy might suggest some sequences terminate at the Rebound node, but this is unlikely for a sports event flow, or there's an aggregation happening. However, the question asks for the total number of rebounds *shown in the diagram*. The numbers on the incoming links directly correspond to sequences *leading into* a rebound event. Therefore, the sum of these incoming links is the best representation of the total number of rebounds depicted.

1.  Identify the relevant nodes: `UNC Offense`, `Foul`, `UMD Offense`.
2.  Analyze the paths originating from `UNC Offense`. These paths represent events that happen immediately after `UNC Offense`.
3.  The paths from `UNC Offense` lead to `Made Shot` (22), `Rebound` (8), `Missed Shot` (9 and 15, totalling 24), and `Foul` (8).
4.  The question asks for fouls made *after* `UNC Offense` and *before* `UMD Offense`. This implies a sequence where `Foul` occurs on a path segment that starts from `UNC Offense` and eventually leads to `UMD Offense`.
5.  Examine the path `UNC Offense` -> `Foul`. There are 8 sequences that take this path.
6.  Look at what happens *after* the `Foul` node reached from `UNC Offense`. The diagram shows a link from this `Foul` node directly to `_Exit`.
7.  There is no link from the `Foul` node (originating from `UNC Offense`) to `UMD Offense`.
8.  Now examine the paths from `UNC Offense` that *do* lead to `UMD Offense`. These are `UNC Offense` -> `Made Shot` -> `UMD Offense`, `UNC Offense` -> `Rebound` -> `UMD Offense`, and `UNC Offense` -> `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense`. None of these paths include `Foul`.
9.  Based *solely* on the explicit paths shown in the diagram, the 8 sequences where a foul occurs after `UNC Offense` terminate at `_Exit` and do not proceed to `UMD Offense`. Therefore, no fouls were made on a path segment that connects `UNC Offense` to `UMD Offense`.
10. The number of fouls made after `UNC Offense` and before `UMD Offense` is the count of sequences that follow a path like `UNC Offense` -> ... -> `Foul` -> ... -> `UMD Offense`. As no such path exists in the diagram, the count is 0.

I found links going into ""UMD Offense"" from ""Made Shot"" (22) and ""Missed Shot"" (24), and also a link originating from ""UNC Offense"" directly to ""Made Shot"" (23) - this seems to be an alternative path from UNC Offense to Made Shot, potentially indicating different types of 'Made Shot' events or a different interpretation of the diagram layout/links.

Looking carefully again, there is a curved link starting from ""UNC Offense"" and ending at ""UMD Offense"", with the numerical label ""23"" next to it.

The user is asking for the total count of ""Missed Shot"" events that occur in sequences starting with ""UNC Offense"" and happening before a ""UMD Offense"" event within the same sequence path.

I will examine each sequence pathway starting from ""UNC Offense"" and identify ""Missed Shot"" nodes. For each ""Missed Shot"" node found, I will check if it appears *before* any ""UMD Offense"" node in that specific sequence branch. I will sum the counts of all such ""Missed Shot"" nodes.

1.  **Column 1:** Starts with UNC Offense (7).
    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (7) -> Missed Shot (7). This Missed Shot node is before the UMD Offense (7) node further down in the sequence. Count = 7.
    -   Pathway continues: Missed Shot (7) -> UMD Offense (7). The Missed Shot occurred before this UMD Offense.
2.  **Column 2:** Starts with UNC Offense (14).
    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (14) -> Rebound (14) -> Missed Shot (14). This Missed Shot node is before the UMD Offense (13) node branching from the Missed Shot node. Count = 14.
    -   Pathway continues: Missed Shot (14) -> UMD Offense (13). The Missed Shot occurred before this UMD Offense.
3.  **Column 3:** Starts with UNC Offense (4).
    -   Pathways include Rebound, Turnover, UMD Offense, Steal. No Missed Shot node is present after UNC Offense in this column. Count = 0.
4.  **Column 4:** Starts with UNC Offense (4).
    -   Pathways include Jump Ball, Foul -> _Exit. No Missed Shot node is present after UNC Offense in this column. Count = 0.
5.  **Column 5:** Starts with UNC Offense (15).
    -   Pathways include Foul -> Made Free Throw -> Made Free Throw -> UMD Offense, or Foul -> Made Free Throw -> _Exit, or Foul -> _Exit. No Missed Shot node is present after UNC Offense in this column. Count = 0.
6.  **Column 6:** Starts with UNC Offense (25).
    -   Pathways include Made Shot, UMD Offense, Missed Shot.
    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (25) -> Missed Shot (15). This Missed Shot node is after UNC Offense (25). There is a UMD Offense (23) node branching from the same UNC Offense node, but the Missed Shot occurred before reaching that branch's UMD Offense node. Count = 15.
    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (25) -> UMD Offense (23). This path goes directly to UMD Offense.
    -   Pathway: UNC Offense (25) -> Made Shot (21). No Missed Shot.

Now, I sum the counts of Missed Shot nodes identified that occurred after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense in their path: 7 (from Column 1) + 14 (from Column 2) + 15 (from Column 6) = 36.

I need to examine the diagram for pathways that start with `UNC Offense` and end with a `Made Shot` or `Made Free Throw` event.

I will trace the paths starting from `_Start` nodes that lead to `UNC Offense` and then follow the links from `UNC Offense` downwards, looking for `Made Shot` or `Made Free Throw` nodes.

1.  **Column 1:** Starts with `_Start 7`, then `UNC Offense 7`. The path goes to `Missed Shot 7`. No made shots by UNC.
2.  **Column 2:** Starts with `_Start 14`, then `UNC Offense 14`. The path goes to `Rebound 14`, then `Missed Shot 14`. No made shots by UNC.
3.  **Column 3:** Starts with `_Start 4`, then `UNC Offense 4`. Paths go to `Rebound 1`, `Turnover 2`, `Steal 2`. No made shots by UNC.
4.  **Column 4:** Starts with `_Start 4`, then `UNC Offense 4`. Paths go to `Jump Ball 1`, `Foul 3`. No made shots by UNC directly shown.
5.  **Column 5:** Starts with `_Start 15`, then `UNC Offense 15`. The path goes to `Foul 15`. From `Foul 15`, there are links to `Made Free Throw 13` and `Made Free Throw 8`. These are shots made during a UNC offensive sequence. Total from this column: 13 + 8 = 21.
6.  **Column 6:** Starts with `_Start 25`, then `UNC Offense 25`. From `UNC Offense 25`, there is a link to `Made Shot 21` and a link to `Missed Shot 15`. The `Made Shot 21` node represents shots made directly within this UNC offensive sequence. Total made shots from this column: 21.

Adding the counts from the relevant columns: 21 (from column 5) + 21 (from column 6) = 42.

The nodes relevant are: `UNC Offense`, `Made Shot`, `Made Free Throw`, and the links connecting them within an offensive sequence.
- In column 5, `UNC Offense` (15) leads via `Foul` (15) to `Made Free Throw` (13) and `Made Free Throw` (8).

The user is asking for the total number of shots made by the UNC offense as shown in the node-link diagram. I need to identify all nodes labeled ""Made Shot"" or ""Made Free Throw"" that occur within a sequence originating from ""_Start"" and explicitly linked to ""UNC Offense"" events.

1.  Examine each column representing different starting points/sequences.
2.  Column 1: Starts with UNC Offense (7). The sequence includes Missed Shot, UMD Offense, Rebound, Missed Shot, and \_Exit. There is no ""Made Shot"" or ""Made Free Throw"" by UNC in this sequence.
3.  Column 2: Starts with UNC Offense (14). The sequence includes Rebound, Missed Shot, UMD Offense, Rebound, and Made Shot (7). The ""Made Shot"" node follows ""UMD Offense"". This shot was made by the UMD offense, not UNC.
4.  Column 3: Starts with UNC Offense (15). The sequence includes Foul (15), Made Free Throw (13), Made Free Throw (8), UMD Offense (8), and \_Exit (15). The ""Made Free Throw"" nodes (13 and 8) follow a ""Foul"" which occurred during a ""UNC Offense"" sequence. Free throws are shots made by the offense. So, 13 sequences resulted in a Made Free Throw, and 8 of those sequences had *another* Made Free Throw. The total number of made free throws within these paths is 13 + 8 = 21. These were made by the UNC offense.
5.  Column 4: Starts with UNC Offense (5). The sequence includes Jump Ball and UMD Offense (5), then Made Shot (4), and \_Exit (5). The ""Made Shot"" node follows ""UMD Offense"". This shot was made by the UMD offense, not UNC.
6.  Column 5: Starts with UNC Offense (28). The sequence includes Rebound (18), Made Shot (16). This ""Made Shot"" node follows ""Rebound"" which is part of the UNC Offense sequence starting with 28. This represents 16 made shots by the UNC offense. The path also branches to UMD Offense (12) and Missed Shot (7), neither of which are made shots by UNC.
7.  Sum the counts of made shots/free throws explicitly linked to UNC Offense sequences:
    *   From Column 3: 21 (Made Free Throws)
    *   From Column 5: 16 (Made Shots)
    *   Total = 21 + 16 = 37.

All identified made shots/free throws (21 and 16) are located downstream from a UNC Offense node within their respective main pathways, and upstream of any potential change of possession to UMD Offense within that specific flow (except where the made shot/free throw *causes* the change of possession or end of sequence). The phrasing ""made by only the UNC offense"" reinforces that I should only count those resulting from UNC possessions, which these do.

I will examine each column representing sequences starting with 'UNC Offense' and look for paths that fit the pattern: `UNC Offense` -> ... -> `Missed Shot` -> ... -> `UMD Offense`. The numbers next to the nodes indicate the number of sequences passing through that node. The links show the transitions between events.

1.  **Column 1:** Starts with `_Start` 2 leading to `UNC Offense` 2. There is a path `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Missed Shot` (2) -> `Made Shot` (2) -> `_Exit` (2). There is no 'UMD Offense' node shown after the 'Missed Shot' in this path. This column contributes 0 to the count.

2.  **Column 2:** Starts with `_Start` 19 leading to `UNC Offense` 19. The path shown is `UNC Offense` (19) -> `Rebound` (19) -> `Missed Shot` (19). From the `Missed Shot` (19) node, there is an explicit link shown leading to the `UMD Offense` (17) node. This means 17 sequences that reached the 'Missed Shot' node then transitioned to the 'UMD Offense' node. Since this path originated from 'UNC Offense', these 17 sequences fit the criteria (Missed Shot after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense). This column contributes 17 to the count.

3.  **Column 3:** Starts with `_Start` 33 leading to `UNC Offense` 33. The path shows `UNC Offense` (33) -> `Made Shot` (28) -> `Missed Shot` (18). This 'Missed Shot' (18) occurs after 'UNC Offense'. To determine if it occurs before 'UMD Offense', I need to see if these 18 sequences explicitly lead to a 'UMD Offense' node. There is a `UMD Offense` (26) node in the same column, but it is positioned above the `Missed Shot` (18) node, indicating it occurs earlier in sequences that went via `Made Shot`. There is a `UMD Offense` (11) node in the next column. However, there is no explicit link drawn from the `Missed Shot` (18) node in Column 3 to any `UMD Offense` node. Based *solely* on the explicit connections shown, I cannot confirm that these 18 sequences include a 'UMD Offense' event after the 'Missed Shot'. This column contributes 0 to the count based on explicit links showing the required transition.

4.  **Column 4:** Starts with `_Start` 15 leading to `UNC Offense` 15. The path shows `UNC Offense` (15) -> `Foul` (15) -> `UMD Offense` (11). There is no 'Missed Shot' event shown between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense' in this path. This column contributes 0 to the count.

Summing the counts from all columns based on explicit links showing the sequence `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense` originating after `UNC Offense`: 0 (Column 1) + 17 (Column 2) + 0 (Column 3) + 0 (Column 4) = 17.

The user is asking for the total number of sequences where a 'Missed Shot' event occurs after a 'UNC Offense' event and before a 'UMD Offense' event, based on the provided node-link diagram.

I will examine each column representing sequences starting with 'UNC Offense' and look for paths that fit the pattern: `UNC Offense` -> ... -> `Missed Shot` -> ... -> `UMD Offense`. The numbers next to the nodes indicate the number of sequences passing through that node. The links show the transitions between events.

1.  **Column 1:** Starts with `_Start` 2 leading to `UNC Offense` 2. There is a path `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Missed Shot` (2) -> `Made Shot` (2) -> `_Exit` (2). There is no 'UMD Offense' node shown after the 'Missed Shot' in this path. This column contributes 0 to the count.

2.  **Column 2:** Starts with `_Start` 19 leading to `UNC Offense` 19. The path shown is `UNC Offense` (19) -> `Rebound` (19) -> `Missed Shot` (19). From the `Missed Shot` (19) node, there is an explicit link shown leading to the `UMD Offense` (17) node. This means 17 sequences that reached the 'Missed Shot' node then transitioned to the 'UMD Offense' node. Since this path originated from 'UNC Offense', these 17 sequences fit the criteria (Missed Shot after UNC Offense and before UMD Offense). This column contributes 17 to the count.

3.  **Column 3:** Starts with `_Start` 33 leading to `UNC Offense` 33. The path shows `UNC Offense` (33) -> `Made Shot` (28) -> `Missed Shot` (18). This 'Missed Shot' (18) occurs after 'UNC Offense'. To determine if it occurs before 'UMD Offense', I need to see if these 18 sequences explicitly lead to a 'UMD Offense' node. There is a `UMD Offense` (26) node in the same column, but it is positioned above the `Missed Shot` (18) node, indicating it occurs earlier in sequences that went via `Made Shot`. There is a `UMD Offense` (11) node in the next column. However, there is no explicit link drawn from the `Missed Shot` (18) node in Column 3 to any `UMD Offense` node. Based *solely* on the explicit connections shown, I cannot confirm that these 18 sequences include a 'UMD Offense' event after the 'Missed Shot'. This column contributes 0 to the count based on explicit links showing the required transition.

4.  **Column 4:** Starts with `_Start` 15 leading to `UNC Offense` 15. The path shows `UNC Offense` (15) -> `Foul` (15) -> `UMD Offense` (11). There is no 'Missed Shot' event shown between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense' in this path. This column contributes 0 to the count.

Summing the counts from all columns based on explicit links showing the sequence `Missed Shot` -> `UMD Offense` originating after `UNC Offense`: 0 (Column 1) + 17 (Column 2) + 0 (Column 3) + 0 (Column 4) = 17.

I need to examine the diagram and find all nodes labeled ""Made Shot"" that are part of sequences originating from or clearly associated with ""UNC Offense"".

The diagram shows four main columns, each representing a set of sequences starting with a specific count (`_Start`).

1.  **Column 1:** Starts with `_Start` 2, followed by `UNC Offense` 2. There is a `Made Shot` node with a count of 2 at the end of the sequence, labeled `Made Shot _Exit`. This `Made Shot` node is reached via a path originating from `UNC Offense`. Specifically, the path is `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Missed Shot` (2) -> `Made Shot _Exit` (2). While it follows a `Missed Shot`, the sequence began with UNC Offense and ended with a Made Shot. Given the structure, these 2 Made Shots are attributed to UNC offense possessions that ended in a made shot after an initial missed shot or jump ball leading to a missed shot.
2.  **Column 2:** Starts with `_Start` 19, followed by `UNC Offense` 19. The paths from here lead to `Rebound`, `Missed Shot`, and then `UMD Offense`. The only `Made Shot` node in this column has a count of 7 and is reached via the path `_Start` (19) -> `UNC Offense` (19) -> ... -> `UMD Offense` (17) -> `Rebound` (15) -> `Made Shot` (7). This `Made Shot` occurs after the possession has switched to UMD Offense, so it is not a UNC Made Shot.
3.  **Column 3:** Starts with `_Start` 33, followed by `UNC Offense` 33. One path directly from `UNC Offense` leads to `Made Shot` 28. These 28 shots are clearly made by the UNC offense. Another path leads to `UMD Offense` 26. The `Made Shot` in this column with count 28 is the only one directly following UNC Offense activity.
4.  **Column 4:** Starts with `_Start` 15, followed by `UNC Offense` 15. This leads to `Foul` 15, and then `UMD Offense` 11 or `_Exit` 4. There are no `Made Shot` nodes in this column.

Based on the diagram, the Made Shots attributable to UNC offense are:
- The 2 `Made Shot _Exit` in Column 1.
- The 28 `Made Shot` in Column 3.

Total UNC Made Shots = 2 (from Column 1) + 28 (from Column 3) = 30.

3.  From those ""Missed Shot"" nodes, trace forward to see if they lead to ""UMD Offense"" nodes.
4.  Sum the number of sequences that follow such paths containing a ""Missed Shot"" between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"".

Let's trace the relevant paths:

*   **Column 2:** The sequence starts with _Start (14) -> UNC Offense (14). From UNC Offense (14), 14 sequences go to Rebound (14). From Rebound (14), 14 sequences go to Missed Shot (14). This Missed Shot (14) is after the UNC Offense. From Missed Shot (14), 13 sequences go to Rebound (13), and 1 goes to \_Exit (1). From Rebound (13), 13 sequences go to UMD Offense (13).
    So, there is a path segment: UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> Rebound -> UMD Offense. This path segment is followed by 13 sequences (indicated by the link counts from Missed Shot to Rebound, and Rebound to UMD Offense). The Missed Shot in these 13 sequences occurs after the UNC Offense and before the UMD Offense. Thus, this contributes 13 missed shots to the total.

*   **Column 5:** The sequence starts with _Start (9) -> UNC Offense (9). From UNC Offense (9), 9 sequences go to Missed Shot (9). This Missed Shot (9) is after the UNC Offense. From Missed Shot (9), 8 sequences go to UMD Offense (8), and 1 goes to Rebound (1). The path going directly to UMD Offense is UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense. This path segment is followed by 8 sequences (indicated by the link count from Missed Shot to UMD Offense). The Missed Shot in these 8 sequences occurs after the UNC Offense and before the UMD Offense. Thus, this contributes 8 missed shots to the total. The path going to Rebound (1) leads to Missed Shot (1) which goes to _Exit (1). This sequence does not reach UMD Offense after the Missed Shot(s).

*   **Other Columns:**
    *   Column 1: UNC Offense (2) -> Jump Ball (1) / Made Shot (2). No Missed Shot after UNC Offense.
    *   Column 3: UNC Offense (12) -> Rebound (5) / Foul (9). No Missed Shot immediately after, and tracing forward from Rebound or Foul does not show paths leading to UMD Offense that pass through a Missed Shot based on the diagram structure.
    *   Column 4: UNC Offense (14) -> Steal (6). From Steal (6), UMD Offense (10) is reached. No Missed Shot between.
    *   Column 6: UNC Offense (18) -> Made Shot (17). From Made Shot (17), UMD Offense (15) is reached. No Missed Shot between.

Based on the explicit paths shown in the diagram where a Missed Shot occurs in a sequence segment starting with UNC Offense and ending with UMD Offense, the relevant sequences are the 13 from Column 2 and the 8 from Column 5.

In the diagram, successful shots are represented by nodes labeled ""Made Shot"" and ""Made Free Throw"". I need to identify all sequences that start with ""UNC Offense"" and lead to these ""Made Shot"" or ""Made Free Throw"" nodes *before* possession potentially changes to ""UMD Offense"".

1.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (2) -> `UNC Offense` (2) -> `Jump Ball` (1) -> `Missed Shot` (2) -> `Made Shot` (2). This path originates from UNC Offense and ends with a Made Shot node with a value of 2. Since no 'UMD Offense' node appears before the 'Made Shot' node in this specific pathway, these 2 shots are counted as made by UNC offense.
2.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (14) -> `UNC Offense` (14) -> `Missed Shot` (14) -> `Rebound` (14) -> `UMD Offense` (13). This path shows possession changing to UMD Offense. Any subsequent ""Made Shot"" or ""Made Free Throw"" nodes in this branch are made by UMD, not UNC. The `Made Shot` (7) node is downstream from the `UMD Offense` node, so it is not counted for UNC.
3.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (12) -> `UNC Offense` (12) -> `Rebound` (5) -> `Foul` (9) -> `Made Free Throw` (10). This path originates from UNC Offense and reaches a ""Made Free Throw"" node with a value of 10. Since no 'UMD Offense' node appears before the 'Made Free Throw' node in this pathway, these 10 shots are counted as made by UNC offense.
4.  Continuing the previous path: `Made Free Throw` (10) leads to `Made Free Throw` (6). These 6 shots are also part of the same UNC offense sequence. Count these 6.
5.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (14) -> `UNC Offense` (14) -> `Steal` (6) -> `UMD Offense` (10). This path shows possession changing to UMD Offense. Any subsequent ""Made Shot"" or ""Made Free Throw"" nodes in this branch are made by UMD, not UNC. The `Made Shot` (3) node is downstream from the `UMD Offense` node, so it is not counted for UNC.
6.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (9) -> `UNC Offense` (9) -> `Missed Shot` (9) -> `UMD Offense` (8). This path shows possession changing to UMD Offense. Any subsequent shots are made by UMD. No Made Shot/Free Throw nodes are reached in this branch anyway.
7.  Following the path starting with `_Start` (18) -> `UNC Offense` (18) -> `Made Shot` (17). This path originates from UNC Offense and reaches a ""Made Shot"" node with a value of 17. Since no 'UMD Offense' node appears before the 'Made Shot' node in this pathway, these 17 shots are counted as made by UNC offense.

Now, sum the counts of ""Made Shot"" and ""Made Free Throw"" nodes identified as being made by UNC offense:
- Made Shot: 2 + 17 = 19
- Made Free Throw: 10 + 6 = 16
Total shots made by UNC offense = 19 + 16 = 35.

The nodes relevant are the ""_Start"" nodes leading to ""UNC Offense"", the ""UNC Offense"" nodes themselves, the ""Made Shot"" nodes, the ""Made Free Throw"" nodes, the ""UMD Offense"" nodes (as indicators of possession change), and the numeric labels next to the nodes/links. I followed the paths from UNC Offense beginnings and summed the values of ""Made Shot"" and ""Made Free Throw"" nodes reached before a ""UMD Offense"" node indicates a turnover.

Calculations:
Path 1: Made Shot (2)
Path 3 & 4: Made Free Throw (10 + 6 = 16)
Path 6: Made Shot (17)
Total = 2 + 16 + 17 = 35.
