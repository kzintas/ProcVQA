The diagram indicates that 100 patients arrived at the emergency department, and 62 of them were admitted to the ICU. Of those admitted to the ICU, 26 were discharged alive, and 36 died. The remaining 38 patients were discharged alive directly from the emergency department.

To find the total number of patients discharged alive, we need to add the number of patients discharged alive from the ICU (26) to the number of patients discharged alive directly from the emergency department (38).

**Total patients discharged alive = 26 + 38 = 64**

The question asks how many made shots were after UNC Offense but before UMD offense.

To answer this question, we need to follow the path from UNC Offense to UMD Offense and count the number of made shots along the way.

The path from UNC Offense to UMD Offense is as follows:

*   UNC Offense
*   Rebound
*   Foul
*   Made Shot
*   Missed Shot
*   Turnover
*   Made Free Throw
*   UMD Offense

There is only one made shot along this path, which is the made shot after the foul.

The diagram has several nodes, each representing an event, and links connecting these nodes, indicating the sequence of events. The links are labeled with numbers, which represent the count of sequences following that path.

To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, we need to identify all the nodes labeled ""Rebound"" and add up the counts of sequences following those nodes.

There are two nodes labeled ""Rebound"" in the diagram. One is connected to the node ""Foul"" with a count of 6, and the other is connected to the node ""Made Shot"" with a count of 7. Additionally, there is another node labeled ""Rebound"" connected to the node ""Turnover"" with a count of 4.

Therefore, the total number of rebounds in the match is 6 + 7 + 4 = 17.

To answer this question, we need to follow the path from UMD Offense to the Steal node. The path is as follows:

UMD Offense → Foul → _Exit → Missed Shot → Steal

The link width between UMD Offense and Foul is 7, which means that 7 sequences followed this path. The link width between Foul and _Exit is 4, which means that 4 sequences followed this path. The link width between _Exit and Missed Shot is 9, which means that 9 sequences followed this path. Finally, the link width between Missed Shot and Steal is 4, which means that 4 sequences followed this path.

Therefore, the total number of steals that occurred after UMD Offense is 4.

To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to count the number of missed shots in each column.

In the UNC offense column, there are two missed shots: one with a count of 2 and another with a count of 14. Therefore, the total number of missed shots made by the UNC offense is 2 + 14 = 16.

In the UMD offense column, there are three missed shots: one with a count of 9, another with a count of 6, and a third with a count of 12. Therefore, the total number of missed shots made by the UMD offense is 9 + 6 + 12 = 27.

Adding the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we get 16 + 27 = 43.

The diagram is divided into two columns, with the left column representing the UNC Offense and the right column representing the UMD Offense.

To determine how many free throws were made by UMD Offense, we need to look at the nodes labeled ""Made Free Throw"" in the right column. There are two such nodes, one with a value of 6 and another with a value of 10. These values represent the number of free throws made by UMD Offense in each instance.

Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is the sum of these two values: 6 + 10 = 16.

    The diagram shows two paths where the UNC offense made shots:
    1. The path from ""Made Shot"" to ""UNC Offense"" with a link width of 2.
    2. The path from ""Made Shot"" to ""UNC Offense"" with a link width of 3.
    To find the total number of shots made by the UNC offense, we add the link widths of these two paths.
    Total shots made by UNC offense = 2 + 3 = 5","**Step 1: Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer.**
