q_38,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,4,How many total patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?,Summing Weights,62,41,No reasoning found,"To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

### 1. Identify the relevant elements:
- The starting point is the `_Start` node, which has 100 patients.
- Patients proceed to the `Arrival` node, where all 100 patients continue.
- From `Arrival`, patients move to the `Emergency` node, where they split into two paths:
  - **Path 1**: 21 patients go to the `Floor`.
  - **Path 2**: 38 patients are discharged alive and exit (`Discharge-Alive` → `_Exit`).

### 2. Focus on the path from `Emergency` to `ICU`:
- From the `Emergency` node, there is a link labeled ""41"" leading directly to the `ICU` node.
- This indicates that 41 patients went directly from `Emergency` to `ICU`.

### 3. Verify if there are any other indirect paths to `ICU`:
- Patients who go to the `Floor` from `Emergency` (21 patients) can also reach `ICU`:
  - From the `Floor` node, 24 patients go to `ICU`.
  - However, these 24 patients are already accounted for in the direct path from `Emergency` to `ICU` (41 patients).
- Therefore, no additional patients reach `ICU` through indirect paths.

### 4. Calculate the total number of patients who went to `ICU` after `Emergency`:
- The total number of patients who went to `ICU` after `Emergency` is explicitly shown as 41.

q_64,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_25.png,6,How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,38,No reasoning found,"To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

### 1. Identify the relevant elements:
- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and ending at various `_Exit` nodes.
- The number next to each link represents the count of sequences following that path.
- We are interested in the number of patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor.

### 2. Trace the pathway:
- **Starting Point**: `_Start` → `Arrival` → `Emergency`
  - All 100 patients start at `_Start` and proceed to `Arrival`.
  - From `Arrival`, all 100 patients proceed to `Emergency`.

- **Branching at `Emergency`**:
  - From `Emergency`, there are two paths:
    1. **Path 1**: `Emergency` → `ICU` (62 patients)
    2. **Path 2**: `Emergency` → `Discharge-Alive` (38 patients)

- **Focus on `Discharge-Alive`**:
  - The question asks about patients discharged alive after going to the Floor.
  - The path leading directly to `Discharge-Alive` (38 patients) indicates these patients were discharged alive without going to the ICU.
  - There is no explicit mention of a ""Floor"" in the diagram, but since the question specifies ""after going to the Floor,"" we must assume the Floor is represented by the `Discharge-Alive` path, as it is the only direct discharge route.

### 3. Calculate the total:
- The number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor is explicitly shown as 38.

### 4. Reasoning:
- The diagram does not explicitly label a ""Floor"" node, but the question implies that the `Discharge-Alive` path represents patients who were discharged alive after going to the Floor.
- Since the `Discharge-Alive` path directly leads to `_Exit` with 38 patients, this is the number we are looking for.

q_69,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_30.png,5,How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,26,No reasoning found,"### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Diagram
The diagram represents a sequence of events for patients, starting from `_Start` and ending at `_Exit`. Each node represents an event, and directed links show the flow of patients between events. The width of the links and the numeric labels indicate the number of sequences (or patients) following each path.

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Nodes and Links
- **Starting Point**: `_Start` → `Arrival` → `Emergency`
- **Branching Point**: From `Emergency`, patients can go to either `ICU` or `Discharge-Alive`.
- **Focus Node**: `ICU`
  - From `ICU`, there are two possible outcomes:
    1. `Die` → `_Exit`
    2. A link leading to another node, which we need to identify as ""Floor.""

### Step 3: Examine the Path from `ICU`
- The link from `ICU` to `Die` is labeled with the number `36`, indicating that 36 patients went from `ICU` to `Die`.
- There is another link from `ICU` that does not lead to `Die`. This link must represent patients going to the ""Floor,"" but the node is not explicitly labeled in the provided diagram. However, since the total number of patients entering `ICU` is `62` (as shown by the link from `Emergency` to `ICU`), we can calculate the number of patients who did not go to `Die`.

### Step 4: Calculate Patients Going to the Floor
- Total patients entering `ICU`: `62`
- Patients going from `ICU` to `Die`: `36`
- Patients going to the ""Floor"":  
  \[
  62 - 36 = 26
  \]

### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
- The total number of patients entering `ICU` is accounted for: `36` (to `Die`) + `26` (to the ""Floor"") = `62`.
- This matches the incoming link count from `Emergency` to `ICU`.

   - From `Floor`, all 23 patients proceed to `Discharge-Alive`.
   - From `ICU`, the 1 patient proceeds to `Die`.

4. **Bottom-right pathway**:
   - Starts with `_Start` → `Arrival` → `Emergency` (27 patients).
   - From `Emergency`, all 27 patients proceed to `Floor`.
   - From `Floor`, all 27 patients proceed to `ICU`.
   - From `ICU`, 18 patients proceed to `Die`, and 9 patients proceed to `Discharge-Alive`.

### 3. Count the patients who died after arriving at Emergency:
- **Top-left pathway**: 12 patients die after arriving at Emergency.
- **Second pathway**: No patients die after arriving at Emergency (all 37 proceed to `Discharge-Alive`).
- **Third pathway**: 1 patient dies after arriving at Emergency.
- **Bottom-right pathway**: 18 patients die after arriving at Emergency.

### 1. Identify the relevant elements:
- The diagram shows a sequence of events starting from `_Start` and leading to various outcomes.
- The node `UMD Offense` is the primary focus, as it represents the UMD team's offensive plays.
- From `UMD Offense`, there are several pathways leading to different outcomes:
  - `Rebound` (34 sequences)
  - `Missed Shot` (14 sequences)
  - `Foul` (8 sequences)
  - `Made Shot` (3 sequences)
  - `_Exit` (implying the end of a sequence without a specific outcome)

### 2. Understand the context of free throws:
- Free throws are typically associated with fouls in basketball. Therefore, we need to focus on the `Foul` node.
- From the `Foul` node, there is a link to `_Exit` with a count of 10 sequences. This suggests that after a foul, the sequence ends, which could imply free throws were made (since fouls often lead to free throws).

### 3. Analyze the `Foul` node:
- The `Foul` node has a total of 8 sequences leading into it from `UMD Offense`.
- All 8 sequences from `Foul` lead to `_Exit`, with a count of 10 sequences. This discrepancy (8 vs. 10) suggests that the 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws made after fouls.

### 4. Reasoning:
- The `Foul` node indicates that 8 sequences involve fouls.
- The 10 sequences leading from `Foul` to `_Exit` suggest that these 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws made after fouls.
- Since the question asks for the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, we can conclude that the 10 sequences represent the total number of free throws.

### 1. Identify the relevant elements:
- The node labeled **""UMD Offense""** is the focal point since we are asked about events immediately after it.
- From ""UMD Offense,"" there are two outgoing links:
  - One link leads to the node labeled **""Rebound""** with a count of **34**.
  - Another link leads directly to the node labeled **""_Exit""** with a count of **35**.

### 2. Interpret the meaning of the links:
- The link from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" suggests that after the UMD offense, a rebound occurred. This implies that a shot was missed because a rebound typically occurs when a shot does not go in.
- The link from ""UMD Offense"" to ""_Exit"" suggests that the sequence ended without a rebound, which could mean the offense resulted in a score or another outcome that did not involve a missed shot.

### 3. Determine the number of missed shots:
- The question asks specifically about shots missed immediately after ""UMD Offense.""
- The only pathway indicating a missed shot is the one leading to ""Rebound,"" as rebounds occur after missed shots.
- The count on the link from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" is **34**.

### 1. Identify the relevant elements:
- The node labeled ""Rebound"" is of interest.
- We need to look at the links originating from the ""Rebound"" node to determine what happens directly after a rebound.
- The link widths and numeric labels on the links indicate the number of sequences following each path.

### 2. Examine the links from the ""Rebound"" node:
- There is only one link originating from the ""Rebound"" node.
- This link leads to the node labeled ""_Exit"".
- The numeric label on this link is **34**, which means 34 sequences follow this path.

### 3. Interpret the meaning of the ""_Exit"" node:
- The ""_Exit"" node typically represents the end of a sequence or a terminal state in such diagrams.
- Since the link from ""Rebound"" directly leads to ""_Exit"", it implies that after a rebound, the sequence ends without any further events (such as a shot being made).

### 4. Consider the question:
- The question asks how many shots were made directly after a Rebound.
- From the diagram, there is no indication of any event (such as a shot) occurring between ""Rebound"" and ""_Exit"". The sequence simply ends after the rebound.

### 5. Conclusion:
- Since the diagram shows that the sequence ends immediately after the rebound (leading to ""_Exit""), there are no shots made directly after a rebound.

- The link from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" has a label of `34`, indicating that 34 sequences involve a rebound after UMD's offense.
- The link from ""UMD Offense"" to `_Exit` has a label of `35`, indicating that 35 sequences end directly after UMD's offense without a rebound.

### 3. Calculate Total Shots by UMD Offense
- Every sequence that passes through ""UMD Offense"" represents an offensive play by UMD.
- The total number of sequences passing through ""UMD Offense"" is the sum of the sequences going to ""Rebound"" and those going directly to `_Exit`.
- Therefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is:
  \[
  34 + 35 = 69
  \]

### 4. Verify Consistency
- The link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"" is labeled `69`, which matches the total number of sequences reaching ""UMD Offense."" This confirms the consistency of the data.

### Reasoning Summary
- The node ""UMD Offense"" is the focal point for determining the total shots made by UMD.
- The outgoing links from ""UMD Offense"" show two possible outcomes: a rebound (`34` sequences) or a direct exit (`35` sequences).
- Summing these outcomes gives the total number of sequences involving UMD's offense, which is `69`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify UNC Offense Nodes:**
   - Look for nodes labeled ""UNC Offense"" in the diagram. These are the starting points for UNC's offensive plays.

2. **Trace Paths from UNC Offense to Made Shot:**
   - From each ""UNC Offense"" node, trace the pathway(s) leading to a ""Made Shot"" node.
   - Ensure that the ""Made Shot"" is directly connected to an ""UNC Offense"" node or through a valid sequence (e.g., no intervening UMD Offense).

3. **Count Sequences for Each Path:**
   - The numeric labels next to the links indicate the number of sequences following that path.
   - Sum the counts for all valid paths leading from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Made Shot.""

### Detailed Path Analysis:

#### Path 1:
- Start at the top-left ""UNC Offense"" node (count = 7).
- Follow the link to ""Missed Shot"" (count = 7).
- This path does not lead to a ""Made Shot,"" so it is not counted.

#### Path 2:
- Move to the second ""UNC Offense"" node (count = 14).
- Follow the link to ""Rebound"" (count = 14).
- From ""Rebound,"" follow the link to ""Made Shot"" (count = 7).
- This path leads to a ""Made Shot"" with a count of 7.

#### Path 3:
- Move to the third ""UNC Offense"" node (count = 4).
- Follow the link to ""Rebound"" (count = 1).
- This path does not lead to a ""Made Shot,"" so it is not counted.

#### Path 4:
- Move to the fourth ""UNC Offense"" node (count = 4).
- Follow the link to ""Jump Ball"" (count = 1).
- This path does not lead to a ""Made Shot,"" so it is not counted.

#### Path 5:
- Move to the fifth ""UNC Offense"" node (count = 15).
- Follow the link to ""Foul"" (count = 15).
- From ""Foul,"" follow the link to ""Made Free Throw"" (count = 13).

### 1. Identify Relevant Elements
- The diagram shows sequences of events in a basketball game, with nodes representing events and directed links showing transitions between events.
- Events related to free throws are not explicitly labeled as ""Free Throw"" in the diagram. However, free throws are typically associated with fouls.
- We need to look for pathways involving ""Foul"" and subsequent ""Made Shot"" events that could represent free throws.

### 2. Analyze the Diagram
#### Pathway Involving Fouls:
- There is a node labeled ""Foul"" with a count of 15, which is part of the pathway starting from `_Start` → `UNC Offense` → `Foul`.
- After the ""Foul,"" the next event is `UMD Offense` with a count of 11.
- From `UMD Offense`, there is a transition to `Made Shot` with a count of 7.

#### Interpretation:
- The ""Foul"" leads to `UMD Offense`, which suggests that UMD gets possession after the foul.
- The `Made Shot` following `UMD Offense` could represent a free throw made by UMD, as it is the most logical interpretation given the context of a foul leading to free throw opportunities.

### 3. Counting Free Throws
- The link from `UMD Offense` to `Made Shot` has a count of 7.
- This count (7) likely represents the number of free throws made by UMD after gaining possession following a foul.

### 4. Reasoning Summary
- The pathway `_Start` → `UNC Offense` → `Foul` → `UMD Offense` → `Made Shot` indicates that UMD made shots after gaining possession due to a foul.
- The count of 7 on the link from `UMD Offense` to `Made Shot` is the most reasonable representation of free throws made by UMD.

q_238,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,1,How many times did a jump ball occur after UNC Offense?,Detect Antecedent Sequealea,1,0,No reasoning found,"To answer the question, let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

### 1. Identify the relevant elements:
- The question asks about the number of times a ""Jump Ball"" occurred after ""UNC Offense.""
- In the diagram, ""UNC Offense"" is represented as a node with a specific color (orange) and label.
- We need to look for directed links from ""UNC Offense"" nodes to ""Jump Ball"" nodes.

### 2. Examine the pathways:
- Starting from the ""Start"" node, we see that there are two sequences leading to ""UNC Offense"" (with counts 2 and 14).
- From the ""UNC Offense"" nodes, we need to trace the links to see if any lead to ""Jump Ball.""

### 3. Trace the links:
- The first ""UNC Offense"" node (count 2) does not have a link to ""Jump Ball."" Instead, it leads to ""Missed Shot.""
- The second ""UNC Offense"" node (count 14) also does not have a direct link to ""Jump Ball."" Instead, it leads to ""Rebound.""

### 4. Check for any indirect paths:
- There are no indirect paths from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Jump Ball"" in the diagram. The ""Jump Ball"" node is only reachable from the ""Start"" node, not from any ""UNC Offense"" node.

### 5. Conclusion:
- Based on the diagram, there are no sequences where a ""Jump Ball"" occurs after ""UNC Offense.""

q_239,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,2,How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?,Summing Weights,23,30,No reasoning found,"To answer the question, we need to identify all pathways in the diagram where ""Missed Shot"" occurs after ""UNC Offense"" but before ""UMD Offense."" Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the relevant sections of the diagram
- We are looking for sequences where:
  1. The sequence starts with ""UNC Offense.""
  2. A ""Missed Shot"" occurs after ""UNC Offense.""
  3. The sequence transitions to ""UMD Offense"" after the ""Missed Shot.""

### Step 2: Trace the pathways
#### Pathway 1: Starting from the first ""UNC Offense"" (top left)
- **Start** → **UNC Offense** (2 sequences)
- From ""UNC Offense,"" there is a link to **Missed Shot** (2 sequences).
- After ""Missed Shot,"" the sequence goes to **Rebound** (2 sequences).
- From ""Rebound,"" the sequence transitions to **UMD Offense** (2 sequences).

#### Pathway 2: Starting from the second ""UNC Offense"" (middle left)
- **Start** → **UNC Offense** (14 sequences)
- From ""UNC Offense,"" there is a link to **Missed Shot** (14 sequences).
- After ""Missed Shot,"" the sequence goes to **Rebound** (14 sequences).
- From ""Rebound,"" the sequence transitions to **UMD Offense** (14 sequences).

#### Pathway 3: Starting from the third ""UNC Offense"" (middle right)
- **Start** → **UNC Offense** (12 sequences)
- From ""UNC Offense,"" there is a link to **Foul** (9 sequences).
- From ""Foul,"" the sequence goes to **Made Free Throw** (10 sequences).
- After ""Made Free Throw,"" the sequence goes to **Missed Shot** (14 sequences).
- From ""Missed Shot,"" the sequence transitions to **UMD Offense** (13 sequences).

#### Pathway 4: Starting from the fourth ""UNC Offense"" (far right)
- **Start** → **UNC Offense** (18 sequences)
- From ""UNC Offense,"" there is a link to **Made Shot** (17 sequences).
- After ""Made Shot,"" the sequence goes to **Rebound** (8 sequences).
- From ""Rebound,"" the sequence transitions to **UMD Offense** (15 sequences).

### Step 3: Count the missed shots
- In **Pathway 1**, there are 2 sequences of ""Missed Shot.""
- In **Pathway 2**, there are 14 sequences of ""Missed Shot.""
- In **Pathway 3**, there are 14 sequences of ""Missed Shot.""
- In **Pathway 4**, there are no ""Missed Shot"" events before ""UMD Offense.""

### Step 4: Sum the total missed shots
The total number of missed shots that occur after ""UNC Offense"" but before ""UMD Offense"" is:
\[ 2 + 14 + 14 = 30 \]

q_240,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,3,How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?,Summing Weights,40,27,No reasoning found,"To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, we need to identify all the ""Rebound"" nodes in the diagram and sum their corresponding sequence counts.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Rebound Nodes:**
   - Look for nodes labeled ""Rebound"" in the diagram.
   - There are three ""Rebound"" nodes visible in the diagram.

2. **Extract Sequence Counts for Each Rebound Node:**
   - The first ""Rebound"" node has a sequence count of **14**.
   - The second ""Rebound"" node has a sequence count of **5**.
   - The third ""Rebound"" node has a sequence count of **8**.

3. **Sum the Sequence Counts:**
   - Total rebounds = 14 + 5 + 8 = 27.

### Reasoning:
- The sequence counts next to each link indicate how many times that particular event occurred in the dataset.
- By summing the sequence counts of all ""Rebound"" nodes, we get the total number of rebounds made by both teams.

q_242,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,5,How many total missed shots were made by both teams?,Summing Weights,43,64,No reasoning found,"To determine the total number of missed shots made by both teams, we need to identify all nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"" and sum the counts associated with them. Let's analyze the diagram step by step:

### Step 1: Identify all ""Missed Shot"" nodes
We will look for all nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"" and note the counts next to the incoming links.

1. **First Pathway (Leftmost)**
   - Node: ""Missed Shot""
   - Count: 14

2. **Second Pathway**
   - Node: ""Missed Shot""
   - Count: 9

3. **Third Pathway**
   - Node: ""Missed Shot""
   - Count: 14

4. **Fourth Pathway**
   - Node: ""Missed Shot""
   - Count: 9

5. **Fifth Pathway**
   - Node: ""Missed Shot""
   - Count: 6

6. **Sixth Pathway**
   - Node: ""Missed Shot""
   - Count: 12

### Step 2: Sum the counts of all ""Missed Shot"" nodes
Now, we add up all the counts from the ""Missed Shot"" nodes:

\[
14 + 9 + 14 + 9 + 6 + 12 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Verify the counts
Each count represents the number of sequences that reached the ""Missed Shot"" node. Since the question asks for the total number of missed shots by both teams, we have accounted for all relevant nodes and their counts.

q_243,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,6,How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,16,No reasoning found,"To answer the question ""How many free throws were made by UMD Offense?"", let's analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

### 1. Identify Relevant Elements
- We need to focus on the pathways involving ""UMD Offense"" and specifically look for links leading to ""Made Free Throw.""
- The diagram shows sequences of events, with link widths and numeric labels indicating the number of sequences following each path.

### 2. Trace the Pathways Involving ""UMD Offense""
- Starting from the ""Start"" node, we see multiple branches leading to different events.
- One of these branches leads to ""UMD Offense,"" which is colored in gray.

#### Pathway Analysis:
- From ""Start,"" there are several paths leading to ""UMD Offense."" We need to follow these paths to see if any lead to ""Made Free Throw.""

##### Path 1: Direct Path to ""UMD Offense""
- From ""Start,"" there is a direct path to ""UMD Offense"" with a count of 9 sequences.
- From ""UMD Offense,"" there is a link to ""Made Shot"" (purple) with a count of 17 sequences.
- There is no direct link from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Made Free Throw"" in this pathway.

##### Path 2: Through ""Missed Shot""
- Another path from ""Start"" goes through ""UNC Offense"" → ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"" → ""UMD Offense.""
- From ""UMD Offense"" in this pathway, there is a link to ""Made Free Throw"" (cyan) with a count of 6 sequences.

##### Path 3: Through ""Foul""
- Another path from ""Start"" goes through ""UNC Offense"" → ""Foul"" → ""UMD Offense.""
- From ""UMD Offense"" in this pathway, there is a link to ""Made Free Throw"" (cyan) with a count of 10 sequences.

### 3. Summarize the Counts of ""Made Free Throw"" for UMD Offense
- From the analysis above, we see two pathways where ""UMD Offense"" leads to ""Made Free Throw"":
  1. Path through ""Rebound"": 6 sequences
  2. Path through ""Foul"": 10 sequences

- Adding these counts together:
  \[
  6 + 10 = 16
  \]

### 4. Final Answer
The total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is the sum of the sequences leading to ""Made Free Throw"" from ""UMD Offense.""

q_244,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,7,How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?,Summing Weights,19,24,No reasoning found,"To answer the question, we need to identify all pathways in the diagram where the UNC offense results in a ""Made Shot"" and count the number of sequences for those specific paths. Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the relevant nodes and links
- The starting point is labeled as ""_Start"".
- The UNC offense is represented by the node ""UNC Offense"".
- A ""Made Shot"" indicates a successful shot by the team in possession.
- We are specifically looking for pathways where the UNC offense leads directly to a ""Made Shot"".

### Step 2: Trace the pathways
We will examine each branch of the diagram where the UNC offense occurs and check if it leads to a ""Made Shot"":

#### Pathway 1:
- Start → UNC Offense (14 sequences) → Made Shot (7 sequences)
  - This is a direct path from UNC Offense to Made Shot with 7 sequences.

#### Pathway 2:
- Start → UNC Offense (12 sequences) → Missed Shot (14 sequences) → Rebound (14 sequences) → UNC Offense (14 sequences) → Made Shot (7 sequences)
  - Although this path includes a missed shot and a rebound, it ultimately leads back to UNC Offense and then to a Made Shot. However, the question asks for shots made **only** by the UNC offense, so we should focus on direct paths without intermediate events like rebounds or missed shots.

#### Pathway 3:
- Start → UNC Offense (14 sequences) → Missed Shot (9 sequences) → Steal (6 sequences) → UMD Offense (10 sequences) → Made Shot (3 sequences)
  - This path does not lead to a Made Shot by the UNC offense; instead, it leads to a Made Shot by UMD after a steal.

#### Pathway 4:
- Start → UNC Offense (9 sequences) → Foul (9 sequences) → Made Free Throw (10 sequences)
  - This path does not lead to a Made Shot by the UNC offense; it leads to a Made Free Throw.

#### Pathway 5:
- Start → UNC Offense (18 sequences) → Made Shot (17 sequences)
  - This is another direct path from UNC Offense to Made Shot with 17 sequences.

### Step 3: Sum the sequences
From the analysis above, the only direct paths from UNC Offense to Made Shot are:
1. Start → UNC Offense (14 sequences) → Made Shot (7 sequences)
2. Start → UNC Offense (18 sequences) → Made Shot (17 sequences)

The total number of sequences where the UNC offense directly results in a Made Shot is:
\[ 7 + 17 = 24 \]
