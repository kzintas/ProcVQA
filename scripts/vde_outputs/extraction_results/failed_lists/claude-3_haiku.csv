<reasoning>
The diagram shows a sequence of events, with each event represented by a node. The vertical position of the nodes indicates the chronological order, with events at the top occurring before events at the bottom.

The relevant nodes for this question are:
- Emergency: This node shows that 62 patients went to the Emergency department.
- Floor: This node is not directly shown, but we can infer that patients who did not go to the ICU or Die would have gone to the Floor.
- Discharge-Alive: This node shows that 38 patients were discharged alive.

To calculate the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor, I need to add up the number of patients who went through the Emergency -> Floor -> Discharge-Alive pathway.

The number of patients who went through this pathway can be calculated by subtracting the number of patients who went to the ICU (36) and the number of patients who died (36) from the total number of patients who went to the Emergency department (62).

62 - 36 - 36 = 0

To determine the total number of shots made by the UMD offense, I will track the complete pathways through the diagram and sum up the values for the UMD Offense node.

The diagram shows two pathways leading from the UMD Offense node:
1. UMD Offense -> Rebound -> Exit, with a value of 34
2. UMD Offense -> Exit, with a value of 35

Adding these two values together gives the total number of shots made by the UMD offense:
34 + 35 = 69

<reasoning>
The diagram shows two main pathways - one for UNC Offense and one for UMD Offense. The vertical position of the nodes indicates chronological order, with the top node representing the ""Start"" of the sequence.

Looking at the UMD Offense pathway, there is a single node labeled ""UMD Offense"" with a value of 69. This represents the total number of events or sequences for the UMD Offense.

The diagram also shows a link between the ""UMD Offense"" node and the ""Exit"" node, with a value of 35 next to the link. This indicates that 35 sequences followed this path from UMD Offense to the Exit.

To calculate the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense, I need to subtract the number of sequences that went to the Exit (35) from the total number of sequences for UMD Offense (69). This gives me the total number of Fouls:

69 (total UMD Offense sequences) - 35 (sequences to Exit) = 34 (total Fouls)
