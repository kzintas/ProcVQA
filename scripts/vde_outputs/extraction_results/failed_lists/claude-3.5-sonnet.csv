q_239,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,2,How many total missed shots occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense?,Summing Weights,23,25,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram to count all missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.

<reasoning>
1. I'll examine each sequence path starting from UNC Offense and look for missed shots before UMD Offense appears:

Path 1 (leftmost):
- UNC Offense → Missed Shot (count: 2)

Path 2:
- UNC Offense → Missed Shot (count: 14)
- This missed shot occurs before UMD Offense

Path 3:
- No missed shots before UMD Offense in this path

Path 4:
- No missed shots before UMD Offense in this path

Path 5:
- UNC Offense → Missed Shot (count: 9)
- This occurs before UMD Offense

Path 6:
- No missed shots before UMD Offense

Adding up all missed shots that occur after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense:
2 + 14 + 9 = 25 total missed shots

q_240,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,3,How many rebounds were made in total by both teams?,Summing Weights,40,27,"Let me analyze the rebounds shown in the node-link diagram.

<reasoning>
1. Looking for all ""Rebound"" nodes in the diagram:
   - First sequence shows no rebounds
   - Second sequence shows a rebound with value 14
   - Third sequence shows a rebound with value 5
   - Fourth sequence shows no rebounds
   - Fifth sequence shows a rebound with value 8
   - Sixth sequence shows no rebounds

2. Adding up all rebound values:
   14 + 5 + 8 = 27 total rebounds

3. Verification:
   - Each rebound node is clearly labeled
   - The values are distinct and connected to different sequences
   - No other rebound events are shown in the diagram

q_241,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,4,How many total made shots were made by both teams?,Summing Weights,29,45,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram to find all made shots by both teams.

<reasoning>
1. Looking for all ""Made Shot"" nodes in the diagram:

First path:
- Made Shot with value 2 (left-most path)

Second path:
- Made Shot with value 7 (after UMD Offense)

Third path:
- Made Shot with value 3 (after UMD Offense)

Fourth path:
- Made Shot with value 17 (right-most path)

2. Adding up all made shots:
2 + 7 + 3 + 17 = 29 total made shots

3. Additionally, need to check for made free throws:
- One ""Made Free Throw"" with value 10
- Another ""Made Free Throw"" with value 6

4. Total made free throws:
10 + 6 = 16 free throws

5. Final calculation:
Total made shots = Regular made shots + Made free throws
29 + 16 = 45 total made shots

<reasoning>
1. Looking through the diagram, I need to find all instances of ""Made Free Throw"" nodes.

2. Following the paths, I can find two instances of ""Made Free Throw"":
   - One path shows 10 made free throws
   - Another path shows 6 made free throws

3. To get the total number of made free throws, I add:
   10 + 6 = 16 made free throws

4. The diagram clearly shows these values through the link widths and numeric labels, making this calculation definitive.

q_244,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,7,How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?,Summing Weights,19,2,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram to determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense.

<reasoning>
1. I need to look for paths that start with ""UNC Offense"" and end with ""Made Shot"" without involving UMD Offense

2. Looking through each sequence:
- First sequence: UNC Offense → Jump Ball → Missed Shot → Made Shot (2 made shots)
- Second sequence: UNC Offense → Rebound → Missed Shot → UMD Offense → Rebound → Made Shot (7 made shots, but after UMD possession)
- Third sequence: UNC Offense → Rebound → Foul → Made Free Throw (no regular made shots)
- Fourth sequence: UNC Offense → Steal → UMD Offense → Made Shot (3 made shots, but after UMD possession)
- Fifth sequence: UNC Offense → Missed Shot → UMD Offense → Rebound → Missed Shot (no made shots)
- Sixth sequence: UNC Offense → Made Shot (17 made shots, but after UMD possession)

3. Looking at direct UNC offense shots:
- Only the first sequence shows made shots (2) that came directly from UNC offense without UMD possession
