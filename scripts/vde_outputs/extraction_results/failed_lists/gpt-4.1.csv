q_38,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,4,How many total patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?,Summing Weights,62,42,"1. Relevant elements:
- The node ""Emergency"" has outgoing links to ""Floor"" (41), ""Discharge-Alive"" (38), and ""ICU"" (21).
- The node ""ICU"" appears twice in the diagram: once directly after ""Emergency"" and once after ""Floor"".
- The question asks for the total number of patients who went to the ICU after ""Emergency"".

<reasoning>
To answer the question, we need to count all patients who went to the ICU at any point after the ""Emergency"" node. 
- First, from ""Emergency"", 21 patients go directly to ""ICU"".
- Next, from ""Emergency"", 41 patients go to ""Floor"". From ""Floor"", 21 go to ""ICU"".
- Additionally, after the first ICU, some patients go to ""Floor"" (24), and from there, 8 go to ICU again.

So, the total number of patients who went to ICU after ""Emergency"" is:
- Directly from ""Emergency"" to ""ICU"": 21
- From ""Emergency"" to ""Floor"" to ""ICU"": 21
- From ""Emergency"" to ""Floor"" to ""ICU"" to ""Floor"" to ""ICU"": 8

However, the 8 patients who go from ""Floor"" to ""ICU"" the second time have already been counted in the 21 who went from ""Floor"" to ""ICU"" the first time, because the path is: Emergency → Floor → ICU → Floor → ICU. So, these 8 are a subset of the 21 who went from Floor to ICU, not an additional group.

Therefore, the total number of unique patients who went to ICU after Emergency is:
- 21 (direct) + 21 (via Floor) = 42

q_44,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_10.png,4,How many total patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?,Summing Weights,62,41,"1. Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer
- The question asks for the total number of patients who went to the ICU after Emergency.
- From the ""Emergency"" node, there are two outgoing links: one to ""Discharge-Alive"" (38) and one to ""Floor"" (21).
- From ""Floor,"" there is a link to ""ICU"" with a value of 41.

<reasoning>
- First, we need to determine how many patients reached the ICU after Emergency.
- From ""Emergency,"" 21 patients go to ""Floor.""
- From ""Floor,"" 41 patients go to ""ICU."" 
- However, the only way to reach ""ICU"" is via ""Floor,"" so all patients who go to ""ICU"" must have come from ""Floor,"" which in turn came from ""Emergency.""
- The diagram shows 41 patients go from ""Floor"" to ""ICU,"" so 41 patients went to the ICU after Emergency.

- The question asks for the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the ""Floor"".
- There are two pathways from ""Emergency"" to ""Floor"":
  - ""Emergency"" → ""Floor"" → ""ICU"" → ""Floor"" → ""Discharge-Alive""
  - ""Emergency"" → ""Floor"" → ""Discharge-Alive""
- The link from ""Emergency"" to ""Floor"" is labeled 41.
- From ""Floor"", 21 go to ""ICU"" and 20 go to ""Discharge-Alive"".
- From ""ICU"", 24 go to ""Floor"" and then all 24 go to ""Discharge-Alive"".

<reasoning>
- First, count the patients who went from ""Floor"" directly to ""Discharge-Alive"":
  - ""Emergency"" → ""Floor"" → ""Discharge-Alive"": 20 patients (as per the link from ""Floor"" to ""Discharge-Alive"").
- Next, count the patients who went from ""Floor"" to ""ICU"", then back to ""Floor"", and then to ""Discharge-Alive"":
  - ""Emergency"" → ""Floor"" → ""ICU"" → ""Floor"" → ""Discharge-Alive"": 24 patients (as per the link from ""ICU"" to ""Floor"" and then ""Floor"" to ""Discharge-Alive"").
- Add both groups together:
  - 20 (direct from Floor) + 24 (via ICU and back to Floor) = 44 patients.

- The nodes present are: _Start, Arrival, Emergency, ICU, Die, Discharge-Alive, _Exit.
- The links and their counts are: 
  - Emergency → ICU (62)
  - Emergency → Discharge-Alive (38)
  - ICU → Die (36)

<reasoning>
- The question asks how many patients went to the Floor after the ICU.
- I need to look for a node labeled ""Floor"" that is directly connected after ""ICU"".
- In the diagram, after ""ICU"", the only outgoing link is to ""Die"" (36 patients).
- There is no node labeled ""Floor"" in the diagram, nor any link from ""ICU"" to a ""Floor"" node.
- Therefore, there is no explicit information about any patients going from ICU to Floor.

q_119,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_05.png,7,How many total Fouls were made by UMD Offense?,Summing Weights,16,14,"<reasoning>
To determine the total number of Fouls made by UMD Offense, I need to identify all the pathways from the ""UMD Offense"" node that lead to a ""Foul"" event.

From the ""UMD Offense"" node, there are two direct paths to ""Foul"":
- One path with a count of 8 (directly from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Foul"")
- Another path through ""Rebound"" (from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" to ""Foul""), with a count of 6 (from ""Rebound"" to ""Foul"")

q_148,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_25.png,4,How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,34,"<reasoning>
1. The node-link diagram shows the sequence of events starting from ""_Start"" to ""UNC Offense"", then to ""UMD Offense"".
2. From ""UMD Offense"", there are two outgoing links:
   - One link goes to ""Rebound"" with a count of 34.
   - The other link goes directly to ""_Exit"" with a count of 35.
3. The question asks for the number of shots missed immediately after ""UMD Offense"".
4. In basketball event sequences, a ""Rebound"" typically follows a missed shot.
5. Therefore, the number of sequences that go from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" (which is 34) represents the number of missed shots immediately after ""UMD Offense"".

q_149,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_25.png,5,How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,0,"<reasoning>
1. The diagram shows the sequence of events starting from ""_Start"" to ""UNC Offense"", then ""UMD Offense"".
2. From ""UMD Offense"", there are two possible next events: ""Rebound"" (with a count of 34) and ""_Exit"" (with a count of 35).
3. After ""Rebound"", the only next event is ""_Exit"" (with a count of 34).
4. The question asks how many shots were made directly after a ""Rebound"".
5. There is no node labeled as ""Shot"" or any similar event after ""Rebound"" in the diagram. The only event after ""Rebound"" is ""_Exit"".
6. Therefore, the diagram does not show any shots made directly after a ""Rebound"".

1. The node-link diagram shows a sequence of events starting from ""_Start"" to ""UNC Offense"", then to ""UMD Offense"".
2. From ""UMD Offense"", there are two outgoing links: one to ""Rebound"" (with a count of 34) and one directly to ""_Exit"" (with a count of 35).
3. The sum of the outgoing links from ""UMD Offense"" is 34 (to ""Rebound"") + 35 (to ""_Exit"") = 69.
4. Since the question asks for the total shots made by UMD offense, and the diagram shows all sequences that pass through ""UMD Offense"" either result in a rebound or an exit, both of which represent the conclusion of a shot attempt, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is the sum of these two paths.

q_161,./Data/SentenTree/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_05.png,1,How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?,Summing Weights,34,7,"1. Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer
- The node ""UMD Offense"" is the starting point for this question.
- We need to count the number of times a ""Rebound"" event occurs directly after ""UMD Offense"".
- From ""UMD Offense"", there are several outgoing links, one of which leads to ""Missed Shot"" (16 sequences).
- From ""Missed Shot"", there is a link to ""Rebound"" (7 sequences).

<reasoning>
- The question asks for the number of rebounds made after ""UMD Offense"".
- From the ""UMD Offense"" node, the only path that leads to a ""Rebound"" is through ""Missed Shot"".
- Specifically, ""UMD Offense"" → ""Missed Shot"" (16) → ""Rebound"" (7).
- Therefore, the number of rebounds made after ""UMD Offense"" is the value on the link from ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound"", which is 7.

- The nodes ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"" are the key elements.
- The question asks for the number of times the transition occurs from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"".
- The links coming out of ""UNC Offense"" and leading directly to ""UMD Offense"" are labeled with their counts.

<reasoning>
- From the diagram, ""UNC Offense"" has several outgoing links.
- The links from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"" are labeled as follows:
  - ""Turnover"" with a count of 24
  - ""Made Free Throw"" with a count of 5
  - ""Rebound"" with a count of 15
  - Adding these up: 24 (Turnover) + 5 (Made Free Throw) + 15 (Rebound) = 44

- The question asks for the number of ""made shots"" that occur after ""UNC Offense"" but before ""UMD Offense.""
- The node ""UNC Offense"" is at the top, and ""UMD Offense"" is the next major event node below it.
- We need to count the number of sequences that go from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Made Shot"" before reaching ""UMD Offense.""

<reasoning>
- From ""_Start"" (69), all sequences go to ""UNC Offense.""
- From ""UNC Offense,"" there is a direct path to ""Made Shot"" with a count of 4.
- After ""Made Shot,"" the only outgoing link is to ""Rebound"" (also 4), and from ""Rebound,"" there is no path that leads to ""UMD Offense"" before another event.
- However, the question specifically asks for made shots that occur after ""UNC Offense"" but before ""UMD Offense."" 
- The only ""Made Shot"" node that is directly after ""UNC Offense"" is the one with a count of 4.
- All other paths from ""UNC Offense"" (such as ""Missed Shot,"" ""Rebound,"" ""Foul,"" ""Turnover,"" ""Made Free Throw"") do not lead to a ""Made Shot"" node before reaching ""UMD Offense.""
- Therefore, the only relevant ""Made Shot"" events are the 4 that occur directly after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense.""

q_165,./Data/SentenTree/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_05.png,5,How many total rebounds are there in the match?,Summing Weights,53,42,"<reasoning>
To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, I need to count every instance where a ""Rebound"" node is reached in the diagram, as each represents a rebound event.

1. From ""UNC Offense"":
   - ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"": 15 sequences
   - ""Rebound"" → ""UNC Offense"": 15 sequences (but this is a loop, not a new rebound event)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""UMD Offense"": 9 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Foul"": 5 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)

2. From ""UMD Offense"":
   - ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"": 27 sequences
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Foul"": 4 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Made Shot"": 7 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Missed Shot"": 6 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Turnover"": 4 sequences (these are counted as rebounds, as the node is reached)

Now, let's sum up all unique instances where a ""Rebound"" node is reached:
- From UNC Offense: 15 (from Missed Shot)
- From UMD Offense: 27 (from Missed Shot)
- From UMD Offense's ""Rebound"" node: 4 (Foul) + 7 (Made Shot) + 6 (Missed Shot) + 4 (Turnover) = 21

However, the 21 rebounds after the first UMD Offense ""Rebound"" node are already included in the 27 rebounds from ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"" (since the 27 splits into these branches). So, we should not double-count them.

Similarly, for UNC Offense, after the first ""Rebound"" node, the 9 (to UMD Offense) and 5 (to Foul) are part of the 15 from ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"".

So, the total number of rebounds is:
- 15 (UNC Offense Missed Shot → Rebound)
- 23 (UNC Offense → Rebound, but this is after a made shot, so not a rebound event)
- 27 (UMD Offense Missed Shot → Rebound)

The ""Rebound"" node directly from ""UNC Offense"" with 23 sequences is not after a missed shot, so it is not a rebound event.

Therefore, the total number of rebounds is:
15 (from UNC Offense missed shots) + 27 (from UMD Offense missed shots) = 42

- The question asks for the number of ""fouls"" that occurred after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"".
- The node ""UNC Offense"" is at the top, and ""UMD Offense"" is the next major event node below it.
- We need to count the number of sequences that go from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Foul"" and then to ""UMD Offense"".

<reasoning>
- From ""_Start"" (69), all sequences go to ""UNC Offense"".
- From ""UNC Offense"", there is a link labeled ""Foul"" with a count of 8.
- From ""Foul"", there are two outgoing links: one to ""Made Free Throw"" (5) and one to ""Made Free Throw"" (4).
- Both ""Made Free Throw"" nodes have links to ""UMD Offense"" (5 and 4, respectively).
- Therefore, the total number of sequences that go from ""UNC Offense"" → ""Foul"" → ""UMD Offense"" is 5 + 4 = 9.

To determine how many rebounds were made after ""UMD Offense,"" I need to look for all links that originate from the ""UMD Offense"" node and go to a ""Rebound"" node. 

From the diagram:
- ""UMD Offense"" has three outgoing links: one to ""_Exit"" (27), one to ""Missed Shot"" (16), and one to ""Foul"" (7).
- The ""Missed Shot"" node after ""UMD Offense"" has two outgoing links: one to ""Rebound"" (7) and one to ""_Exit"" (9).
- The ""Rebound"" node after ""UMD Offense"" has one outgoing link to ""Made Shot"" (7), which then leads to ""_Exit"" (7).

The only direct link labeled ""Rebound"" after ""UMD Offense"" is from ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound"" with a value of 7.

- The question asks for the number of ""missed shots"" that occurred before ""UMD Offense.""
- The node ""UMD Offense"" is reached from ""UNC Offense"" via three possible paths: ""Made Shot,"" ""Missed Shot,"" and ""Foul.""
- Only the path ""Missed Shot"" from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"" is relevant for counting missed shots before ""UMD Offense.""
- The link from ""UNC Offense"" to ""Missed Shot"" is labeled with the value 15.
- The link from ""Missed Shot"" to ""UMD Offense"" is also labeled with the value 15.

<reasoning>
To answer the question, I need to count how many times a ""Missed Shot"" event occurs before reaching ""UMD Offense."" 
- From the diagram, ""UNC Offense"" leads to ""Missed Shot"" with a count of 15.
- All 15 of these ""Missed Shot"" events then directly lead to ""UMD Offense.""
- There are no other paths leading to ""UMD Offense"" that involve a ""Missed Shot"" before reaching it.

To determine the total number of rebounds in the match, I need to count all the times the ""Rebound"" node is reached in the diagram.

1. From ""UNC Offense"":
   - ""Missed Shot"" (15) leads to ""Rebound"" (9).
   - ""Rebound"" (9) leads to ""UMD Offense"".

To determine the total number of rebounds made by both teams, I need to count all the occurrences of the ""Rebound"" event node in the diagram and sum the values on the links leading to or from these nodes.

- In the leftmost pathway:
  - After ""Missed Shot"" (7), there is a ""Rebound"" node with a link labeled 7.
  - After ""Missed Shot"" (14), there is a ""Rebound"" node with a link labeled 14.
  - After ""Missed Shot"" (6), there is a ""Rebound"" node with a link labeled 7.
  - After ""Missed Shot"" (11), there is a ""Rebound"" node with a link labeled 11.

- In the middle pathway:
  - After ""Missed Shot"" (15), there is no ""Rebound"" node, so no rebound is counted here.

- In the rightmost pathways:
  - There are no additional ""Rebound"" nodes.

Now, I sum the values for all the ""Rebound"" nodes:
- 7 (first ""Rebound"")
- 14 (second ""Rebound"")
- 7 (third ""Rebound"")
- 11 (fourth ""Rebound"")

Total rebounds = 7 + 14 + 7 + 11 = 39

- I need to find all nodes labeled ""Made Free Throw"" that are directly connected to ""UMD Offense"" and sum the counts.

<reasoning>
- I scan the diagram for all occurrences of ""UMD Offense.""
- I see two pathways where ""UMD Offense"" leads to ""Made Free Throw"":

- The node ""Made Free Throw"" appears twice in the rightmost pathway:
    - First, ""Made Free Throw"" with a count of 13
    - Then, ""Made Free Throw"" with a count of 8
- Both of these are in the context of UMD Offense, as the sequence is: ""UNC Offense"" → ""Foul"" → ""Made Free Throw"" → ""UMD Offense"" → ""Made Free Throw""

- The nodes labeled ""UNC Offense"" represent the start of UNC's offensive sequences.
- The nodes labeled ""Made Shot"" and ""Missed Shot"" represent shot attempts.
- We are asked for shots made by only the UNC offense, so we need to count the ""Made Shot"" nodes that are directly connected from ""UNC Offense"" sequences, without any intermediate ""UMD Offense"" node before the shot.

<reasoning>
- Start by following all pathways that begin with ""UNC Offense"".
- For each pathway, look for a ""Made Shot"" node that is reached before any ""UMD Offense"" node appears in the sequence.
- From the leftmost pathway:
  - 7 sequences: UNC Offense → Missed Shot (not made), so not counted.
- Next pathway:
  - 14 sequences: UNC Offense → Rebound → Missed Shot → Rebound → Made Shot (7). The ""Made Shot"" node is reached after two rebounds, but no ""UMD Offense"" node appears before the ""Made Shot"". So, 7 made shots here.
- Next pathway:
  - 4 sequences: UNC Offense → Rebound → Turnover → UMD Offense (no shot by UNC).
- Next pathway:
  - 4 sequences: UNC Offense → Jump Ball → Foul → Steal → UMD Offense (no shot by UNC).
- Next pathway:
  - 15 sequences: UNC Offense → Foul → Made Free Throw (13), Made Free Throw (8), UMD Offense (8). No ""Made Shot"" node, so not counted.
- Rightmost pathway:
  - 25 sequences: UNC Offense → Made Shot (21), UMD Offense (23), Missed Shot (15). The ""Made Shot"" node (21) is directly after ""UNC Offense"" and before any ""UMD Offense"" node, so these are made by only the UNC offense.

- Starting from the left, I look for any ""UMD Offense"" nodes and trace their subsequent events.
- In the third pathway from the left, the sequence is: _Start (15) → UNC Offense (15) → Foul (15) → Made Free Throw (13) → Made Free Throw (8) → UMD Offense (8).
- The ""Made Free Throw"" nodes in this sequence are both after a ""Foul"" and are part of the UMD Offense sequence (since the foul leads to free throws for the opposing team, UMD).
- The first ""Made Free Throw"" node has a link labeled 13, and the second ""Made Free Throw"" node has a link labeled 8.
- These are the only ""Made Free Throw"" nodes in the diagram, and both are part of the UMD Offense sequence.

- ""Made Shot"" nodes are the relevant event for made shots.
- We need to count only those ""Made Shot"" events that occur directly after ""UNC Offense"" and not after a transition to ""UMD Offense.""

<reasoning>
Step 1: Locate all ""Made Shot"" nodes in the diagram.
- There are three ""Made Shot"" nodes visible:
  - One after ""UNC Offense"" (path: _Start → UNC Offense → Made Shot) with a count of 7.
  - One after ""UMD Offense"" (path: _Start → UNC Offense → Jump Ball → UMD Offense → Made Shot) with a count of 4.
  - One after ""UNC Offense"" (path: _Start → UNC Offense → Rebound → Made Shot) with a count of 16.

Step 2: Determine which ""Made Shot"" nodes are made by only the UNC offense.
- The first ""Made Shot"" (count 7) is directly after ""UNC Offense"" and not after a transition to ""UMD Offense.""
- The second ""Made Shot"" (count 4) is after ""UMD Offense,"" so it does not count.
- The third ""Made Shot"" (count 16) is after ""UNC Offense"" (via Rebound), so it counts as a UNC offense made shot.

Step 3: Add the counts for the relevant ""Made Shot"" nodes.
- 7 (directly after UNC Offense)

To answer the question, we need to count the number of ""Missed Shot"" events that occur after a ""UNC Offense"" event and before a ""UMD Offense"" event in the diagram.

Let's examine each pathway from top to bottom:

1. The first column (leftmost) has ""UNC Offense"" (2), followed by ""Missed Shot"" (2), then ""UMD Offense"" (9). Here, both ""Missed Shot"" events (2) occur after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"".

2. The second column starts with ""UNC Offense"" (13), then ""Foul"" (13), then ""Made Free Throw"" (12), then ""UMD Offense"" (9). There are no ""Missed Shot"" events in this pathway.

3. The third column starts with ""UNC Offense"" (26), then splits into ""Rebound"" (26), then ""Missed Shot"" (25), then ""Rebound"" (17), then ""Made Shot"" (9), then ""_Exit"" (26). However, after the first ""UNC Offense"" (26), the next ""Missed Shot"" (25) is followed by ""Rebound"" (17), not ""UMD Offense"". But, after ""Missed Shot"" (25), there is no direct ""UMD Offense"" event before the next ""UNC Offense"" or ""_Exit"". So, these ""Missed Shot"" events do not fit the criteria.

4. The fourth column starts with ""UNC Offense"" (21), then ""Made Shot"" (20), then ""UMD Offense"" (18), then ""Missed Shot"" (12), then ""_Exit"" (21). Here, the ""Missed Shot"" (12) occurs after ""UMD Offense"", not after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"".

5. The fifth column starts with ""UNC Offense"" (7), then ""Turnover"" (4), then ""UMD Offense"" (7), then ""_Exit"" (7). No ""Missed Shot"" events here.

Summing up, only the first pathway contains ""Missed Shot"" events (2) that occur after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"".

Step 1: Locate all ""UNC Offense"" nodes and trace their outgoing links to ""Made Shot"" nodes.
- On the leftmost path: 
  - From ""_Start"" (2) → ""UNC Offense"" (2) → ""Made Shot"" (2) → ""_Exit"" (2)
  - This path shows 2 made shots by UNC offense.

- In the middle section:

  - The ""Made Shot"" (7) here is after a ""UMD Offense"" and a ""Rebound,"" not directly after ""UNC Offense,"" so it does not count as ""only the UNC offense.""

- On the rightmost path:
  - From ""_Start"" (33) → ""UNC Offense"" (33) → ""Made Shot"" (28) → ""_Exit"" (33)
  - This path shows 28 made shots by UNC offense.

Step 2: Check for any other ""Made Shot"" nodes directly after ""UNC Offense.""
- The path from ""_Start"" (15) → ""UNC Offense"" (15) → ""Foul"" (15) → ""UMD Offense"" (11) → ""_Exit"" (15) does not contain a ""Made Shot"" after ""UNC Offense.""
- All other ""Made Shot"" nodes are either after a ""Rebound"" or after a ""UMD Offense,"" so they do not count.
