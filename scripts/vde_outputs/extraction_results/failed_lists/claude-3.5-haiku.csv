q_1,./Data/CoreFlow/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,2,How many total patients were discharged alive?,Summing Weights,62,64,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

<reasoning>
1. The diagram starts with 100 patients at the ""Start"" node
2. All 100 patients arrive and go through the ""Emergency"" node
3. From Emergency, patients split into two paths:
   - 62 patients go to ICU
   - 38 patients take a direct path to ""Discharge-Alive""
4. From ICU, patients further split:
   - 36 patients die and exit
   - 24 patients go to Floor
   - 2 patients also go to Discharge-Alive
5. From Floor, patients split:
   - 24 patients go to Discharge-Alive
6. Total patients discharged alive:
   - 38 (direct from Emergency)
   + 2 (from ICU)
   + 24 (from Floor)
   = 64 patients

q_4,./Data/CoreFlow/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,5,How many patients went to the Floor after the ICU?,Detect Antecedent Sequealea,24,26,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

<reasoning>
1. I first look at the path from ICU to Floor
2. I see two links connecting ICU to Floor:
   - One link with value 24 (leading to Discharge-Alive)
   - One link with value 2 (leading to Exit)
3. To find the total number of patients going from ICU to Floor, I will sum these values
4. 24 + 2 = 26 patients went from ICU to Floor

q_25,./Data/CoreFlow/emergency_dataset/msp_25.png,2,How many total patients were discharged alive?,Accurately Read Edge Weights,38,64,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

<reasoning>
1. The diagram starts with 100 patients at the ""Start"" node
2. All 100 patients proceed to the ""Arrival"" node
3. At the ""Emergency"" node, the patients split into two paths:
   - 62 patients go to the ICU
   - 38 patients go directly to ""Discharge-Alive""
4. Of the 62 ICU patients:
   - 36 patients die
   - 26 patients exit to ""Discharge-Alive""
5. To calculate total patients discharged alive, I'll add the two ""Discharge-Alive"" paths:
   - Direct Discharge-Alive: 38 patients
   - ICU Discharge-Alive: 26 patients
   - Total Discharge-Alive: 38 + 26 = 64 patients

q_35,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,1,How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?,Accurately Read Edge Weights,36,57,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram carefully to determine how many patients died after arriving at Emergency.

<reasoning>
1. I'll trace the pathways from the Emergency node that lead to death
2. From Emergency, there are two paths:
   - One path goes through Floor (21 patients)
   - Another path goes through ICU (36 patients)
3. Both of these paths ultimately lead to the ""Die"" node
4. So I'll add the number of patients on these paths: 21 + 36 = 57 patients

Key observations:
- The diagram shows 100 total patients arrived at Emergency
- 57 patients died after being at Emergency
- These deaths occurred via different intermediate stages (Floor and ICU)

q_38,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,4,How many total patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?,Summing Weights,62,21,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram step by step:

<reasoning>
1. I'll trace the paths from the ""Emergency"" node to the ""ICU"" node
2. From the Emergency node, there are two paths leading to ICU:
   - One path shows 41 patients going to Floor first, then 21 of those patients go to ICU
   - Another path shows 38 patients directly going to Discharge-Alive, so these do not go to ICU
3. To find the total patients going to ICU after Emergency, I'll add the number of patients on the paths to ICU
   - 41 patients go from Emergency to Floor, then 21 of those go to ICU
   - So the total number of patients going to ICU after Emergency is 21

q_71,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/emergency_dataset/alpha_05.png,1,How many patients died after arriving at Emergency?,Summing Weights,30,indeterminate,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram to determine how many patients died after arriving at Emergency.

<reasoning>
1. I'll look at the ""Die Exit"" node and its connection from Emergency
2. In the first diagram (leftmost), the ""Die Exit"" node has a label of 12, which means 12 patients died
3. I'll verify this by checking the other diagrams to ensure consistency
4. In the second diagram, the ""Die Exit"" node has 0 patients
5. In the third diagram, the ""Die Exit"" node has 0 patients

<reasoning>
1. I'll look for a direct link from ""Emergency"" to ""Discharge-Alive_Exit""
2. In the first diagram (leftmost), I see:
   - 12 patients arrive at Emergency
   - There is a direct link from Emergency to Discharge-Alive_Exit with the value 37
3. This means 37 patients were discharged alive directly from Emergency
4. However, the question asks how many patients got discharged alive directly after arriving at Emergency
5. The number of patients arriving at Emergency is 12

q_74,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/emergency_dataset/alpha_05.png,4,How many patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?,Summing Weights,35,12,"Let me analyze the node-link diagram to determine how many patients went to the ICU after Emergency.

<reasoning>
1. I'll look at the first column (leftmost) of the visualization
2. I see the ""Emergency"" node (green) has a value of 12
3. From Emergency, there's a direct link to the ICU node (red)
4. The ICU node also has a value of 12
5. This indicates that all 12 patients who went through Emergency subsequently went to the ICU

To verify, I'll quickly check the other columns to ensure consistency:
- Second column: 37 patients go to Emergency, but the ICU link shows 37
- Third column: 24 patients go to Emergency, ICU link shows 23
- Fourth column: 27 patients go to Emergency, ICU link shows 24

<reasoning>
1. I first observe the diagram shows a sequence of events starting from Start, going through UNC Offense, then UMD Offense
2. The link from UNC Offense to UMD Offense has a numeric label of 69
3. This means that 69 times the sequence went from UNC Offense to UMD Offense
4. The question specifically asks ""How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?""

<reasoning>
1. I'll trace the links between UNC Offense and UMD Offense nodes
2. Looking at the diagram, I see two possible paths from UNC Offense to UMD Offense:
   - Via ""Made Shot"" (with a link value of 22)
   - Via ""Missed Shot"" (with a link value of 24)
3. The total number of transitions will be the sum of these link values
