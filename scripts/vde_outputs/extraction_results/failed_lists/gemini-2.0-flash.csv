q_28,./Data/CoreFlow/emergency_dataset/msp_25.png,6,How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,,No reasoning found," Patients go through the following states: _Start, Arrival, Emergency. From Emergency, 62 patients go to ICU and 38 patients go to Discharge-Alive. From the Discharge-Alive node, 38 patients go to _Exit.
 The question asks about patients discharged alive after going to the Floor. The diagram does not have a node named Floor.

 Patients discharged alive go through Emergency -> Discharge-Alive -> _Exit. There are 38 patients that go from Emergency to Discharge-Alive and then 38 patients that go from Discharge-Alive to _Exit. The diagram does not include going to the Floor.
Therefore, the number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor cannot be determined.

   - We need to find the number of ""Missed Shot"" events that occur after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense.""
   - We need to consider the connections between these nodes.

2. **Trace the pathways:**
   - In the first column, ""UNC Offense"" starts with a count of 2. Following the path, we see a ""Missed Shot"" with a count of 2. This is before any ""UMD Offense"" event.
   - In the second column, ""UNC Offense"" starts with a count of 14. After it, there is a ""Rebound"". Then there is a ""Missed Shot"" node with a count of 14. After that there is a UMD Offense node with a count of 13. Therefore, the ""Missed Shot"" node with a count of 14 appears before ""UMD Offense"".
   - In the fourth column, there is ""Rebound 5"", followed by a ""Foul 9"". After it we see two ""Made Free Throw"", then ""_Exit"". There is no ""Missed Shot"" and ""UMD Offense"" in this branch.
   - In the fifth column, we see that after ""UNC Offense"", a ""Steal"" happens. Then ""UMD Offense"" and ""Made Shot"" happen. This branch does not have ""Missed Shot"".
   - In the sixth column, we see ""UNC Offense"", then ""Missed Shot"" with count of 9, then ""UMD Offense"" with count of 8. In this branch, ""Missed Shot"" happens before ""UMD Offense"".
   - In the last column, we see ""UNC Offense"" followed by ""Made Shot"", then ""UMD Offense"", and ""Missed Shot"". In this branch, ""Missed Shot"" happens after ""UMD Offense"".

   - The ""Missed Shot"" count in the first column is 2.
   - The ""Missed Shot"" count in the second column is 14.
