q_148,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_25.png,4,How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,34,"1.  The question asks for the number of shots missed immediately after the ""UMD Offense"" event.
2.  In basketball or similar sports, a ""Rebound"" event usually occurs after a missed shot. Therefore, sequences going from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" can be interpreted as missed shots followed by a rebound.
3.  Locate the ""UMD Offense"" node in the diagram.
4.  Observe the outgoing links from ""UMD Offense"". There are two outgoing links:
    *   One link goes to the ""Rebound"" node. The numeric label next to this link is 34. This indicates that 34 sequences proceed from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"".
    *   Another link goes to the ""_Exit"" node. The numeric label next to this link is 35. This indicates that 35 sequences proceed from ""UMD Offense"" directly to ""_Exit"".
5.  Since ""Rebound"" is the event that signifies a missed shot was taken and an attempt was made to recover the ball, the number of sequences leading from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" represents the number of missed shots (that were then rebounded) immediately after ""UMD Offense"".

q_162,./Data/SentenTree/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_05.png,2,How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?,Summing Weights,60,55,"1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the total number of times ""UMD Offense"" transitioned from ""UNC Offense"". This means we need to count all sequences that start with ""UNC Offense"" and eventually lead to ""UMD Offense"".

2.  **Identify Key Nodes:**
    *   Starting Node: ""UNC Offense""
    *   Ending Node: ""UMD Offense""

3.  **Identify Paths and Flows:** We need to trace all paths from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"" and sum the number of sequences following these paths. The most direct way to do this is to identify all links that directly lead into ""UMD Offense"" and ensure the sequences on these links originated from ""UNC Offense"".

4.  **Examine Links Leading into ""UMD Offense"":**
    There are three nodes that have direct links leading into ""UMD Offense"":
    *   ""Turnover""
    *   ""Made Free Throw"" (the second instance of this node, after ""Foul"")
    *   ""Made Shot"" (the one on the right side, after ""Rebound"")

5.  **Trace and Quantify Sequences for Each Path:**

    *   **Path via ""Turnover"":**
        *   The link from ""Turnover"" to ""UMD Offense"" has a value of **24**.
        *   We need to confirm these 24 sequences originated from ""UNC Offense"".
            *   ""Turnover"" receives 24 sequences from ""Missed Shot"" (the one on the left).
            *   This ""Missed Shot"" node receives sequences from two sources:
                *   15 sequences from ""Rebound"" (which receives 15 from ""UNC Offense"").
                *   9 sequences directly from ""UNC Offense"".
            *   So, the ""Missed Shot"" node receives 15 + 9 = 24 sequences, all originating from ""UNC Offense"". These 24 sequences then proceed to ""Turnover"" and then to ""UMD Offense"".
        *   Contribution from this path: **24 sequences**.

    *   **Path via ""Made Free Throw"":**
        *   The link from ""Made Free Throw"" (the second one) to ""UMD Offense"" has a value of **4**.
        *   We need to confirm these 4 sequences originated from ""UNC Offense"".
            *   This ""Made Free Throw"" node receives 4 sequences from a preceding ""Made Free Throw"" node.
            *   The first ""Made Free Throw"" node receives 5 sequences from ""Foul"".
            *   ""Foul"" receives 8 sequences from ""UNC Offense"".
            *   Tracing the flow: ""UNC Offense"" (sends 8 to) -> ""Foul"" (sends 5 to) -> ""Made Free Throw"" (first, sends 4 to) -> ""Made Free Throw"" (second, sends 4 to) -> ""UMD Offense"".
            *   The number of sequences successfully traversing this path to ""UMD Offense"" is limited by the narrowest link in this specific sequence of events, which results in 4 sequences.
        *   Contribution from this path: **4 sequences**.

    *   **Path via ""Made Shot"":**
        *   The link from ""Made Shot"" (on the right) to ""UMD Offense"" has a value of **27**.
        *   We need to confirm these 27 sequences originated from ""UNC Offense"".
            *   This ""Made Shot"" node receives sequences from two sources originating from ""UNC Offense"":
                *   4 sequences from ""Rebound"" (the one on the top right, which receives 4 from ""UNC Offense"").
                *   23 sequences directly from ""UNC Offense"".
            *   So, this ""Made Shot"" node receives 4 + 23 = 27 sequences, all originating from ""UNC Offense"". These 27 sequences then proceed to ""UMD Offense"".
        *   Contribution from this path: **27 sequences**.

6.  **Sum the Contributions:**
    Total transitions from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"" = (sequences via Turnover) + (sequences via Made Free Throw) + (sequences via Made Shot)
    Total = 24 + 4 + 27 = 55.

7.  **Verification (Optional Check of Flow Conservation):**
    *   Total outgoing links from ""UNC Offense"": 15 (to Rebound left) + 9 (to Missed Shot left) + 8 (to Foul) + 4 (to Rebound right) + 23 (to Made Shot right) = 59 sequences.
    *   Let's see how many of these 59 reach ""UMD Offense"":
        *   From the 15+9=24 to Missed Shot (left) path, all 24 reach UMD Offense.
        *   From the 8 to Foul path: 8 -> Foul -> 5 to MFT1 -> 4 to MFT2 -> 4 to UMD Offense. So, 4 sequences out of the initial 8 reach UMD Offense. (4 sequences are ""lost"" or diverted from this specific path to UMD Offense: 3 at Foul, 1 at MFT1).
        *   From the 4+23=27 to Made Shot (right) path, all 27 reach UMD Offense.
    *   Total reaching UMD Offense = 24 + 4 + 27 = 55.
    *   This matches the sum of inflows to ""UMD Offense"". The 59 sequences initially leaving ""UNC Offense"" result in 55 reaching ""UMD Offense"", with 4 sequences being diverted along the ""Foul"" -> ""Made Free Throw"" path.
    *   The node ""_Start"" indicates 69 sequences going to ""UNC Offense"". 69 - 59 = 10 sequences from ""UNC Offense"" are not accounted for by the subsequent drawn paths, suggesting they might exit or follow other unshown paths, but this does not affect the count of transitions *to* ""UMD Offense"" which is based on the explicitly shown pathways.

2.  **Locate the ""UNC Offense"" node:** This is a major node near the top of the diagram.

3.  **Trace paths originating from ""UNC Offense"" and look for ""Made Shot"" events:**
    *   Path 1: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 15) ""Rebound"" -> (link with 15) ""Missed Shot"" -> (link with 24) ""Turnover"" -> (link with 5) ""UMD Offense"". This path does not contain a ""Made Shot"" event.
    *   Path 2: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 9) ""Missed Shot"" -> (link with 24) ""Turnover"" -> (link with 5) ""UMD Offense"". This path does not contain a ""Made Shot"" event.
    *   Path 3: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 8) ""Foul"" -> (link with 5) ""Made Free Throw"" -> (link with 4) ""Made Free Throw"" -> (link with 4) ""UMD Offense"". This path contains ""Made Free Throw"" but not ""Made Shot"".
    *   Path 4: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 4) ""Made Free Throw"" -> (link with 4) ""UMD Offense"". This path contains ""Made Free Throw"" but not ""Made Shot"".
    *   Path 5: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 23) ""Rebound"" -> (link with 4) ""Made Shot"" -> (link with 27) ""UMD Offense"". This path *does* contain a ""Made Shot"" event. This ""Made Shot"" event occurs after ""UNC Offense"" (via ""Rebound"") and before ""UMD Offense"".

4.  **Determine the number of sequences for the relevant ""Made Shot"":**
    *   In Path 5, the event ""Made Shot"" is found.
    *   The link leading from ""Rebound"" (which follows ""UNC Offense"") to this ""Made Shot"" node has a numeric label of ""4"".
    *   According to the instructions, ""Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences following that path"".
    *   Therefore, 4 sequences followed the path segment ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Rebound"" -> ""Made Shot"". This means there were 4 instances of ""Made Shot"" that occurred after ""UNC Offense"" (specifically, after a Rebound resulting from UNC's offense) and before ""UMD Offense"".

5.  **Check for other ""Made Shot"" events fitting the criteria:**
    *   There is another ""Made Shot"" node visible in the diagram, but it occurs after ""UMD Offense"" -> ""Rebound"" -> ""Made Shot"". This is not between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"", so it is not relevant to the question.

6.  **Final Count:** The only ""Made Shot"" events that occur after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"" are the 4 instances identified in Path 5. The link from ""Rebound"" to ""Made Shot"" is ""4"".

The link from ""Made Shot"" to ""UMD Offense"" has a value of 27. This might seem inconsistent if only 4 sequences entered ""Made Shot"" from the ""UNC Offense -> Rebound"" path.

1.  **Identify the start and end points of the relevant sequence segment:** The question asks for ""made shots"" that occur *after* ""UNC Offense"" and *before* ""UMD Offense"".

2.  **Locate the ""UNC Offense"" node:** This is a major node near the top of the diagram.

3.  **Trace paths originating from ""UNC Offense"" and look for ""Made Shot"" events:**
    *   Path 1: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 15) ""Rebound"" -> (link with 15) ""Missed Shot"" -> (link with 24) ""Turnover"" -> (link with 5) ""UMD Offense"". This path does not contain a ""Made Shot"" event.
    *   Path 2: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 9) ""Missed Shot"" -> (link with 24) ""Turnover"" -> (link with 5) ""UMD Offense"". This path does not contain a ""Made Shot"" event.
    *   Path 3: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 8) ""Foul"" -> (link with 5) ""Made Free Throw"" -> (link with 4) ""Made Free Throw"" -> (link with 4) ""UMD Offense"". This path contains ""Made Free Throw"" but not ""Made Shot"".
    *   Path 4: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 4) ""Made Free Throw"" -> (link with 4) ""UMD Offense"". This path contains ""Made Free Throw"" but not ""Made Shot"".
    *   Path 5: ""UNC Offense"" -> (link with 23) ""Rebound"" -> (link with 4) ""Made Shot"" -> (link with 27) ""UMD Offense"". This path *does* contain a ""Made Shot"" event. This ""Made Shot"" event occurs after ""UNC Offense"" (via ""Rebound"") and before ""UMD Offense"".

4.  **Determine the number of sequences for the relevant ""Made Shot"":**
    *   In Path 5, the event ""Made Shot"" is found.
    *   The link leading from ""Rebound"" (which follows ""UNC Offense"") to this ""Made Shot"" node has a numeric label of ""4"".
    *   According to the instructions, ""Numeric labels next to links show the exact count of sequences following that path"".
    *   Therefore, 4 sequences followed the path segment ""UNC Offense"" -> ""Rebound"" -> ""Made Shot"". This means there were 4 instances of ""Made Shot"" that occurred after ""UNC Offense"" (specifically, after a Rebound resulting from UNC's offense) and before ""UMD Offense"".

5.  **Check for other ""Made Shot"" events fitting the criteria:**
    *   There is another ""Made Shot"" node visible in the diagram, but it occurs after ""UMD Offense"" -> ""Rebound"" -> ""Made Shot"". This is not between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"", so it is not relevant to the question.

6.  **Final Count:** The only ""Made Shot"" events that occur after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"" are the 4 instances identified in Path 5. The link from ""Rebound"" to ""Made Shot"" is ""4"".

The link from ""Made Shot"" to ""UMD Offense"" has a value of 27. This might seem inconsistent if only 4 sequences entered ""Made Shot"" from the ""UNC Offense -> Rebound"" path. However, the question asks ""How many made shots were..."", which refers to the number of sequences that included that event in the specified context. This is determined by the flow *into* the ""Made Shot"" node from paths originating after ""UNC Offense"". In this case, it's 4.

2.  First, I locate the 'UNC Offense' node in the diagram.
3.  Next, I locate the 'UMD Offense' node in the diagram.
4.  I then examine all the pathways and intermediate nodes that exist between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense'.
5.  The pathways from 'UNC Offense' are:
    *   'UNC Offense' -> 'Made Shot' (22 sequences) -> 'UMD Offense' (22 sequences)
    *   'UNC Offense' -> 'UMD Offense' (23 sequences) - This is a direct path, so no intermediate event.
    *   'UNC Offense' -> 'Rebound' (15 sequences) -> 'Missed Shot' (15 sequences) -> 'UMD Offense' (24 sequences). Note: The link from 'Missed Shot' to 'UMD Offense' has a count of 24, which suggests that the 15 sequences from 'Rebound' -> 'Missed Shot' are part of these 24 sequences. However, it also means that there might be other paths leading to 'Missed Shot' that are not shown originating from 'UNC Offense'. For the purpose of this question, we are looking for a 'Foul' node.
6.  The intermediate nodes between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense' are 'Made Shot', 'Rebound', and 'Missed Shot'.
7.  I check if any of these intermediate nodes are labeled 'Foul'.
8.  The nodes are 'Made Shot', 'Rebound', and 'Missed Shot'. None of these are 'Foul'.
9.  Therefore, based on the provided diagram, there is no event explicitly labeled 'Foul' occurring between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense'.
10. The question asks ""How many fouls were made"". Since there is no ""Foul"" node in the specified segment of the diagram, the number of fouls is 0 according to the diagram. However, the instructions state ""If the answer cannot be determined from the visualization, respond with 'indeterminate'"". Since the event ""Foul"" is not represented at all in the relevant part of the diagram, we cannot determine if fouls occurred and were simply not tracked, or if they definitively did not occur. But given the instruction to answer *solely* based on what is *explicitly shown*, and no 'Foul' node is shown, the count of fouls shown is 0.
11. Re-evaluating: If an event type (like ""Foul"") is not present as a node in the specified path, it means that according to this diagram, such an event did not occur in the sequences shown. So the count would be 0. ""Indeterminate"" would be more appropriate if the diagram was ambiguous or incomplete in a way that prevented counting something that *is* represented. Here, ""Foul"" is simply not represented in that segment.
12. Let's consider the strict interpretation: ""Answer **solely** based on what is explicitly shown in the visualization"". If a ""Foul"" event node is not present between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"", then the number of such events shown is 0.
13. The diagram shows specific event types. If 'Foul' was an event type tracked in this sequence, it would be represented by a node. Since there's no 'Foul' node between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense', the diagram indicates 0 such events.
14. If the question implies that fouls *could* have happened but are not shown, then it would be indeterminate. But the phrasing ""How many fouls were made"" based on the diagram suggests counting the 'Foul' events explicitly shown. Since none are shown in that segment, the count is 0.
15. Let's double check the definition of ""indeterminate"". ""If the answer **cannot be determined** from the visualization"". If we interpret this as ""the visualization does not provide information about fouls"", then it's indeterminate. If we interpret it as ""the visualization shows zero fouls"", then it's 0.
16. The context states ""Each event is represented by a node with a label"". If a foul event occurred and was part of the data being visualized, it should be represented by a node. Since no such node exists between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense', the visualization shows 0 fouls in that sequence.
17. Consider the possibility that a ""Foul"" node exists elsewhere in the diagram but not in this specific path. This doesn't change the answer for *this specific path*.
18. If there is no node called 'Foul' between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense', then based solely on the diagram, no fouls are shown to have occurred in that segment. Therefore, the count is 0.
19. Let's assume the question implies ""How many events explicitly labeled 'Foul' are present..."". In this case, the answer is 0.
20. The wording ""cannot be determined"" usually applies when the information is missing or ambiguous, not when an element is explicitly absent. The absence of a ""Foul"" node is explicit information that, according to this diagram, no fouls were recorded/occurred in this part of the sequence.

Final decision: The diagram explicitly shows the events that occurred. If a ""Foul"" event was part of these sequences between UNC Offense and UMD Offense, it would be represented by a node. Since no such node exists, the number of fouls shown in the diagram for this segment is 0.","<reasoning>

14. If the question implies that fouls *could* have happened but are not shown, then it would be indeterminate. But the phrasing ""How many fouls were made"" based on the diagram suggests counting the 'Foul' events explicitly shown. Since none are shown in that segment, the count is 0.
15. Let's double check the definition of ""indeterminate"". ""If the answer **cannot be determined** from the visualization"". If we interpret this as ""the visualization does not provide information about fouls"", then it's indeterminate. If we interpret it as ""the visualization shows zero fouls"", then it's 0.
16. The context states ""Each event is represented by a node with a label"". If a foul event occurred and was part of the data being visualized, it should be represented by a node. Since no such node exists between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense', the visualization shows 0 fouls in that sequence.
17. Consider the possibility that a ""Foul"" node exists elsewhere in the diagram but not in this specific path. This doesn't change the answer for *this specific path*.
18. If there is no node called 'Foul' between 'UNC Offense' and 'UMD Offense', then based solely on the diagram, no fouls are shown to have occurred in that segment. Therefore, the count is 0.
19. Let's assume the question implies ""How many events explicitly labeled 'Foul' are present..."". In this case, the answer is 0.
20. The wording ""cannot be determined"" usually applies when the information is missing or ambiguous, not when an element is explicitly absent. The absence of a ""Foul"" node is explicit information that, according to this diagram, no fouls were recorded/occurred in this part of the sequence.

Final decision: The diagram explicitly shows the events that occurred. If a ""Foul"" event was part of these sequences between UNC Offense and UMD Offense, it would be represented by a node. Since no such node exists, the number of fouls shown in the diagram for this segment is 0.

We need to find ""Made Free Throw"" events in the diagram and determine if they were made by UMD Offense.

2.  **Locate ""Made Free Throw"" Events:**
    *   In the fifth column from the left, there is a sequence starting with `_Start (15) -> UNC Offense (15) -> Foul (15)`.
    *   Following the ""Foul"" node (committed by UNC Offense), there is a node `Made Free Throw` with a count of 13.
    *   Following this first `Made Free Throw (13)` node, there is another `Made Free Throw` node with a count of 8.

3.  **Attribute Free Throws to UMD Offense:**
    *   The sequence shows that ""UNC Offense"" committed a ""Foul"".
    *   In basketball, when one team fouls, the opposing team is typically awarded free throws.
    *   The diagram features ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"" as the two teams. Therefore, if UNC Offense fouls, UMD Offense would be the team to shoot and make the free throws.
    *   Thus, the ""Made Free Throw"" events following the ""Foul"" by ""UNC Offense"" are attributable to UMD Offense.

4.  **Interpret the Counts of ""Made Free Throw"" Events:**
    *   The first `Made Free Throw` node has a count of 13. This means that in 13 sequences, a first (or potentially only) free throw was made by UMD Offense. This accounts for 13 successfully made free throws.
    *   The second `Made Free Throw` node has a count of 8. This node follows the first `Made Free Throw` node, indicating that in 8 of those sequences where a first free throw was made, a second free throw was also made by UMD Offense. This accounts for an additional 8 successfully made free throws.

5.  **Calculate Total Made Free Throws by UMD Offense:**
    *   The total number of free throws made by UMD Offense is the sum of the counts of these distinct ""Made Free Throw"" events attributed to them.
    *   Number of first free throws made = 13.
    *   Number of second free throws made = 8.
    *   Total made free throws by UMD Offense = 13 + 8 = 21.

    Alternatively, this can be viewed as:
    *   There are 8 sequences where two free throws were made by UMD (8 sequences * 2 FTs/sequence = 16 FTs).
    *   There are (13 - 8) = 5 sequences where only one free throw was made by UMD (5 sequences * 1 FT/sequence = 5 FTs).
    *   Total made free throws = 16 + 5 = 21.
    Both interpretations lead to the same result. The simpler interpretation is that the node ""Made Free Throw (13)"" represents 13 individual made shots, and ""Made Free Throw (8)"" represents another 8 distinct individual made shots.

6.  **Verify No Other Instances:** A scan of the entire diagram confirms that these are the only ""Made Free Throw"" events shown. There are no other sequences leading to ""Made Free Throw"" that could be attributed to UMD Offense.

This means looking for sequences where ""UMD Offense"" is in possession and then a ""Made Free Throw"" event occurs, or where a ""Made Free Throw"" event is otherwise clearly linked to UMD Offense making the shot.

1.  **Identify ""Made Free Throw"" events:**

    To attribute these free throws, I need to look at the sequence of events leading up to them in that third column.
    The sequence is:
    _Start (15) -> UNC Offense (15) -> Foul (15) -> Made Free Throw (13) -> Made Free Throw (8) -> UMD Offense (8) -> _Exit (15).
    *   ""UNC Offense (15)"" indicates that UNC (University of North Carolina) had possession of the ball.
    *   ""Foul (15)"" occurs while UNC is on offense. In basketball, this typically means the defending team committed a foul against UNC. Therefore, UNC would be the team to shoot the resulting free throws.
    *   The events ""Made Free Throw (13)"" and ""Made Free Throw (8)"" immediately follow the ""Foul"". This strongly suggests these free throws were made by UNC Offense. The first indicates 13 made free throws (or free throws made in 13 sequences), and the second indicates 8 further made free throws (or free throws made in 8 of those sequences, e.g., a second shot).
    *   ""UMD Offense (8)"" occurs *after* these ""Made Free Throw"" events. This means UMD (University of Maryland) gained possession of the ball only *after* UNC had taken and made these free throws.
    *   Therefore, the 13 and 8 made free throws shown in this column were made by UNC Offense, not UMD Offense.

3.  **Check if UMD Offense leads to any ""Made Free Throw"" events elsewhere:**
    I will examine all instances of ""UMD Offense"" and see what event follows it.
    *   **Column 1 (_Start 7):** ... -> UMD Offense (7) -> Rebound (7) -> ...

    The sequence is:

        *   Here, UMD Offense is followed by ""Missed Shot"". No ""Made Free Throw"" by UMD.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    Based on the examination of all ""Made Free Throw"" events and all sequences involving ""UMD Offense"", there are no instances in the diagram where UMD Offense makes a free throw. The only ""Made Free Throw"" events depicted were made by UNC Offense.

Therefore, the total number of free throws made by UMD Offense, according to the provided visualization, is 0.

1.  **Identify ""Made Free Throw"" Events:**
    The diagram shows one node labeled ""Made Free Throw"" with an associated value of 12 (let's call this MFT12). This means there were 12 instances of made free throws recorded in this part of the sequence.

2.  **Determine Who Made These 12 Free Throws:**
    To determine which team made these free throws, we need to look at the context:
    *   The MFT12 node is preceded by `_Start (13) -> UNC Offense (13) -> Foul (13)`. This indicates that UNC was on offense, and a foul occurred.
    *   Typically, if a team is on offense and a foul leads to free throws, it's because the *defending* team committed the foul, and the team on *offense* shoots the free throws. So, UNC Offense -> Foul (by UMD) -> Made Free Throw (by UNC).
    *   Critically, let's examine what happens *after* the MFT12 event. The MFT12 node has outgoing links to:
        *   `UMD Offense (9)`: 9 sequences proceed to UMD having offensive possession.
        *   `Foul (3)`: 3 sequences proceed to a Foul event.
    *   In basketball, after a team (Team A) makes free throws, the opposing team (Team B) typically inbounds the ball and gains offensive possession.
    *   The sequence `Made Free Throw (12) -> UMD Offense (9)` strongly implies that the team that made the free throws was *UNC*, and consequently, UMD gained possession. If UMD had made the free throws, UNC would have gained possession next, which is not what the diagram shows as the primary path (9 sequences).

    Therefore, the 12 ""Made Free Throw"" events are attributed to UNC, not UMD.

3.  **Look for Other Instances of UMD Making Free Throws:**
    We need to search for any other ""Made Free Throw"" events or sequences where UMD Offense is fouled and then makes free throws.
    *   Consider the path originating from MFT12 (made by UNC):
        *   `Made Free Throw (by UNC, 12) -> UMD Offense (9)`. Now UMD is on offense for 9 sequences.
            *   From `UMD Offense (9)`, there's an outgoing link to `Foul (3)`. This means that in 3 of these sequences where UMD was on offense, a foul occurred. Since UMD was on offense, this foul was likely committed by UNC (defense). This situation *should* lead to UMD attempting free throws.
        *   `Made Free Throw (by UNC, 12) -> Foul (3)`. This means that in 3 sequences, immediately after UNC made free throws (and UMD would be taking possession), a foul occurred. Again, UMD would be the team on offense (or about to be), so this foul was likely committed by UNC against UMD. This situation *should* also lead to UMD attempting free throws.
    *   The `Foul (3)` node is the recipient of these sequences. However, looking at the diagram, this `Foul (3)` node does *not* have an outgoing link to any ""Made Free Throw"" node. It appears to lead to `_Exit` (implied as it's at the end of that path segment in the column).
    *   This means that while there were 3 instances where UMD was on offense and a foul occurred (which should result in free throw attempts by UMD), the diagram does *not explicitly show* these attempts resulting in ""Made Free Throw"" events for UMD.

4.  **Conclusion Based Solely on Visualization:**
    *   The only ""Made Free Throw"" event explicitly shown in the diagram (MFT12) is attributed to UNC based on the subsequent possession change.
    *   Situations where UMD was fouled while on offense (totaling 3 instances leading to the ""Foul (3)"" node) do not lead to a ""Made Free Throw"" node in this diagram.
    *   Since the question asks for how many free throws were *made* by UMD Offense, and the diagram does not show any ""Made Free Throw"" events attributable to UMD, the answer must be 0.

The instructions state to answer ""solely based on what is explicitly shown"". The diagram explicitly shows one ""Made Free Throw"" event (12 occurrences), and the context (possession following the FTs) indicates these were made by UNC. There are no other ""Made Free Throw"" events shown, particularly none following fouls committed against UMD when UMD was on offense.","<reasoning>
The user is asking for the number of free throws made by UMD Offense based on the provided node-link diagram.

1.  **Identify ""Made Free Throw"" Events:**
    The diagram shows one node labeled ""Made Free Throw"" with an associated value of 12 (let's call this MFT12). This means there were 12 instances of made free throws recorded in this part of the sequence.

2.  **Determine Who Made These 12 Free Throws:**
    To determine which team made these free throws, we need to look at the context:
    *   The MFT12 node is preceded by `_Start (13) -> UNC Offense (13) -> Foul (13)`. This indicates that UNC was on offense, and a foul occurred.
    *   Typically, if a team is on offense and a foul leads to free throws, it's because the *defending* team committed the foul, and the team on *offense* shoots the free throws. So, UNC Offense -> Foul (by UMD) -> Made Free Throw (by UNC).
    *   Critically, let's examine what happens *after* the MFT12 event. The MFT12 node has outgoing links to:
        *   `UMD Offense (9)`: 9 sequences proceed to UMD having offensive possession.
        *   `Foul (3)`: 3 sequences proceed to a Foul event.
    *   In basketball, after a team (Team A) makes free throws, the opposing team (Team B) typically inbounds the ball and gains offensive possession.
    *   The sequence `Made Free Throw (12) -> UMD Offense (9)` strongly implies that the team that made the free throws was *UNC*, and consequently, UMD gained possession. If UMD had made the free throws, UNC would have gained possession next, which is not what the diagram shows as the primary path (9 sequences).

    Therefore, the 12 ""Made Free Throw"" events are attributed to UNC, not UMD.

2.  **Analyzing each column for UNC Made Shots:**

    *   **Column 1 (starts with _Start 2):**
        *   Path: _Start (2) -> UNC Offense (2)
        *   From ""UNC Offense (2)"", one relevant path is: UNC Offense (2) -> Missed Shot (2).
        *   From ""Missed Shot (2)"", there's a path: Missed Shot (2) -> Made Shot (2).
        *   This sequence is: UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> Made Shot. The count for this ""Made Shot"" is 2.
        *   To attribute this ""Made Shot (2)"" to UNC: Since ""UMD Offense"" (or any indication of change of possession to the opponent) is not shown between ""UNC Offense"" and this ""Made Shot"", it's reasonable to infer that this ""Made Shot"" is a continuation of UNC's offensive actions (e.g., a tip-in or a quick score after an offensive rebound, even if the rebound itself isn't explicitly shown as a separate node in this specific path). If it were a UMD shot, the diagram should ideally show a transition to ""UMD Offense"" first, as it does in other columns.
        *   So, these 2 ""Made Shot"" events are attributed to UNC.

    *   **Column 2 (starts with _Start 19):**
        *   Path: _Start (19) -> UNC Offense (19)
        *   From ""UNC Offense (19)"", possible next events are ""Rebound (19)"", ""Missed Shot (19)"", and ""UMD Offense (17)"".
        *   The paths ""UNC Offense -> Rebound"" and ""UNC Offense -> Missed Shot"" do not show a subsequent ""Made Shot"" for UNC in this column.
        *   The path ""UNC Offense -> UMD Offense (17)"" indicates a change of possession.
        *   Following ""UMD Offense (17)"", there is ""Made Shot (7)"". These 7 shots are made by UMD, not UNC.
        *   So, no ""Made Shot"" events are attributed to UNC from this column.

    *   **Column 3 (starts with _Start 33):**
        *   Path: _Start (33) -> UNC Offense (33)
        *   From ""UNC Offense (33)"", there is a direct path: UNC Offense (33) -> Made Shot (28).
        *   This ""Made Shot (28)"" directly follows ""UNC Offense"", clearly indicating these 28 shots were made by UNC.
        *   Other paths from ""UNC Offense (33)"" are to ""UMD Offense (26)"" (change of possession) and ""Missed Shot (18)"" (which doesn't lead to a UNC made shot in this branch).
        *   So, 28 ""Made Shot"" events are attributed to UNC from this column.

    *   **Column 4 (starts with _Start 15):**
        *   Path: _Start (15) -> UNC Offense (15)
        *   From ""UNC Offense (15)"", paths lead to ""Foul (15)"" and ""UMD Offense (11)"".
        *   ""Foul"" is not explicitly linked to ""Made Shot"". We cannot assume made free throws unless shown.
        *   ""UMD Offense"" indicates a change of possession.
        *   So, no ""Made Shot"" events are attributed to UNC from this column.

3.  **Summing up UNC Made Shots:**
    *   From Column 1: 2 made shots by UNC.
    *   From Column 3: 28 made shots by UNC.
    *   Total made shots by UNC = 2 + 28 = 30.

This interpretation relies on the principle that unless a change of possession to ""UMD Offense"" is explicitly shown, a ""Made Shot"" event occurring in a sequence initiated by ""UNC Offense"" is attributable to UNC.

I need to examine the pathways in the node-link diagram to find sequences matching this pattern and sum the counts of such ""Missed Shot"" events. The numeric labels next to the links indicate the exact count of sequences following that path.

1.  **Identify ""Missed Shot"" nodes:** I will look for all nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"".
2.  **Check preceding event:** For each ""Missed Shot"" node, I will trace back to see if it is preceded by a ""UNC Offense"" event in its sequence.
3.  **Check succeeding event:** For each ""Missed Shot"" node that meets condition 2, I will trace forward to see if it is followed by a ""UMD Offense"" event. The ""Missed Shot"" must be *before* the ""UMD Offense"".
4.  **Sum counts:** The number of sequences for each qualifying path will be taken from the link connecting the ""Missed Shot"" (or an intermediate event) to the ""UMD Offense"", or more precisely, the link originating from the ""Missed Shot"" that leads to a ""UMD Offense"" down that path.

    *   From this ""Missed Shot"" node:
        *   There is a link to ""UMD Offense"" with a value of 13. This represents 13 sequences following the path: UNC Offense -> Rebound -> **Missed Shot** -> UMD Offense.
        *   In these 13 sequences, the ""Missed Shot"" occurs after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"". So, these 13 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences count.
        *   There is another link from this ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound"" with a value of 13. This path is UNC Offense -> Rebound -> **Missed Shot** -> Rebound -> Made Shot (7). This path does not lead to ""UMD Offense"". So, the ""Missed Shot"" events in these 13 sequences do not satisfy the ""before UMD Offense"" condition through this branch.

*   **Column 3 (starting with _Start 12):**
    *   Paths from ""UNC Offense (12)"" go to ""Rebound (5)"" or ""Foul (9)"". No ""Missed Shot"" is shown in a position that could be between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"".

*   **Column 4 (starting with _Start 14):**
    *   Paths from ""UNC Offense (14)"" go to ""Steal (6)"", ""UMD Offense (10)"", or ""Made Shot (3)"".
    *   The path UNC Offense (14) -> UMD Offense (10) does not have a ""Missed Shot"" in between. So, 0 from here.
    *   Other paths do not show a ""Missed Shot"" leading to ""UMD Offense"".

    *   Path: _Start (9) -> UNC Offense (9) -> Missed Shot. (The node label for Missed Shot is 9).
    *   From this ""Missed Shot"" node:
        *   There is a link to ""UMD Offense"" with a value of 8. This represents 8 sequences following the path: UNC Offense -> **Missed Shot** -> UMD Offense.
        *   In these 8 sequences, the ""Missed Shot"" occurs after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"". So, these 8 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences count.
        *   There is another link from this ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound"" with a value of 8. This path is UNC Offense -> **Missed Shot** -> Rebound (8) -> Missed Shot (6). The diagram does not show what follows ""Missed Shot (6)"". Since it's not explicitly shown to lead to ""UMD Offense"", the initial ""Missed Shot"" on this branch (for 8 sequences) cannot be confirmed as ""before UMD Offense"". Similarly, ""Missed Shot (6)"" itself is not shown to be before ""UMD Offense"".

*   **Column 6 (starting with _Start 18):**
    *   Path: _Start (18) -> UNC Offense (18) -> Made Shot (17).
    *   From ""Made Shot (17)"":
        *   One link goes to ""UMD Offense (15)"". The path is UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense. There is no ""Missed Shot"" between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"" on this path.
        *   Another link goes to ""Missed Shot (12)"". The path is UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> **Missed Shot (12)**. This ""Missed Shot"" is after ""UNC Offense"". However, the diagram does not show this ""Missed Shot (12)"" leading to a ""UMD Offense"" event. Therefore, it cannot be counted as occurring ""before UMD Offense"".

Summing the counts from the qualifying paths:
- From Column 2: 13 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences (UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense).
- From Column 5: 8 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences (UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense).

Total = 13 + 8 = 21.
The interpretation relies on the link values representing the number of sequences following that specific transition, and the condition ""before UMD Offense"" requires a clear path to UMD Offense from the Missed Shot.","<reasoning>
The question asks for the total number of ""Missed Shot"" events that occur after ""UNC Offense"" but before ""UMD Offense"". I need to examine the pathways in the node-link diagram to find sequences matching this pattern and sum the counts of such ""Missed Shot"" events. The numeric labels next to the links indicate the exact count of sequences following that path.

1.  **Identify ""Missed Shot"" nodes:** I will look for all nodes labeled ""Missed Shot"".
2.  **Check preceding event:** For each ""Missed Shot"" node, I will trace back to see if it is preceded by a ""UNC Offense"" event in its sequence.
3.  **Check succeeding event:** For each ""Missed Shot"" node that meets condition 2, I will trace forward to see if it is followed by a ""UMD Offense"" event. The ""Missed Shot"" must be *before* the ""UMD Offense"".
4.  **Sum counts:** The number of sequences for each qualifying path will be taken from the link connecting the ""Missed Shot"" (or an intermediate event) to the ""UMD Offense"", or more precisely, the link originating from the ""Missed Shot"" that leads to a ""UMD Offense"" down that path.

Let's examine the diagram column by column, focusing on paths involving ""UNC Offense"", ""Missed Shot"", and ""UMD Offense"".

*   **Column 1 (starting with _Start 2):**
    *   Path: _Start (2) -> UNC Offense (2) -> Missed Shot (2) -> Made Shot (2) -> _Exit (2).
    *   Here, ""Missed Shot"" (2 sequences) occurs after ""UNC Offense"".
    *   However, it is followed by ""Made Shot"", not ""UMD Offense"". So, these 2 do not count.

*   **Column 2 (starting with _Start 14):**
    *   Path: _Start (14) -> UNC Offense (14) -> Rebound (14) -> Missed Shot. (The node label for Missed Shot is 14, indicating 14 sequences pass through it from Rebound).
    *   From this ""Missed Shot"" node:
        *   There is a link to ""UMD Offense"" with a value of 13. This represents 13 sequences following the path: UNC Offense -> Rebound -> **Missed Shot** -> UMD Offense.
        *   In these 13 sequences, the ""Missed Shot"" occurs after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"". So, these 13 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences count.
        *   There is another link from this ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound"" with a value of 13. This path is UNC Offense -> Rebound -> **Missed Shot** -> Rebound -> Made Shot (7). This path does not lead to ""UMD Offense"". So, the ""Missed Shot"" events in these 13 sequences do not satisfy the ""before UMD Offense"" condition through this branch.

*   **Column 3 (starting with _Start 12):**
    *   Paths from ""UNC Offense (12)"" go to ""Rebound (5)"" or ""Foul (9)"". No ""Missed Shot"" is shown in a position that could be between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"".

*   **Column 4 (starting with _Start 14):**
    *   Paths from ""UNC Offense (14)"" go to ""Steal (6)"", ""UMD Offense (10)"", or ""Made Shot (3)"".
    *   The path UNC Offense (14) -> UMD Offense (10) does not have a ""Missed Shot"" in between. So, 0 from here.
    *   Other paths do not show a ""Missed Shot"" leading to ""UMD Offense"".

*   **Column 5 (starting with _Start 9):**
    *   Path: _Start (9) -> UNC Offense (9) -> Missed Shot. (The node label for Missed Shot is 9).
    *   From this ""Missed Shot"" node:
        *   There is a link to ""UMD Offense"" with a value of 8. This represents 8 sequences following the path: UNC Offense -> **Missed Shot** -> UMD Offense.
        *   In these 8 sequences, the ""Missed Shot"" occurs after ""UNC Offense"" and before ""UMD Offense"". So, these 8 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences count.
        *   There is another link from this ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound"" with a value of 8. This path is UNC Offense -> **Missed Shot** -> Rebound (8) -> Missed Shot (6). The diagram does not show what follows ""Missed Shot (6)"". Since it's not explicitly shown to lead to ""UMD Offense"", the initial ""Missed Shot"" on this branch (for 8 sequences) cannot be confirmed as ""before UMD Offense"". Similarly, ""Missed Shot (6)"" itself is not shown to be before ""UMD Offense"".

*   **Column 6 (starting with _Start 18):**
    *   Path: _Start (18) -> UNC Offense (18) -> Made Shot (17).
    *   From ""Made Shot (17)"":
        *   One link goes to ""UMD Offense (15)"". The path is UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> UMD Offense. There is no ""Missed Shot"" between ""UNC Offense"" and ""UMD Offense"" on this path.
        *   Another link goes to ""Missed Shot (12)"". The path is UNC Offense -> Made Shot -> **Missed Shot (12)**. This ""Missed Shot"" is after ""UNC Offense"". However, the diagram does not show this ""Missed Shot (12)"" leading to a ""UMD Offense"" event. Therefore, it cannot be counted as occurring ""before UMD Offense"".

Summing the counts from the qualifying paths:
- From Column 2: 13 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences (UNC Offense -> Rebound -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense).
- From Column 5: 8 ""Missed Shot"" occurrences (UNC Offense -> Missed Shot -> UMD Offense).

Total = 13 + 8 = 21.
The interpretation relies on the link values representing the number of sequences following that specific transition, and the condition ""before UMD Offense"" requires a clear path to UMD Offense from the Missed Shot.
