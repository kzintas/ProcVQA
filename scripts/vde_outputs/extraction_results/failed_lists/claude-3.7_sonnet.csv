q_38,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,4,How many total patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?,Summing Weights,62,49,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many total patients went to the ICU after Emergency.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to track all paths that go from ""Emergency"" to ""ICU"" directly or indirectly.

From the ""Emergency"" node, I can see the following paths:
1. Emergency → Floor (21 patients)
2. Emergency → Discharge-Alive (38 patients) 
3. Emergency → ICU (41 patients)

The question asks for patients who went to ICU after Emergency. There are two ways this could happen:
- Directly from Emergency to ICU: 41 patients
- Indirectly from Emergency → Floor → ICU: From Floor, I see 8 patients went to ICU

So the total number of patients who went to ICU after Emergency is 41 (direct path) + 8 (indirect path) = 49 patients.

q_40,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_05.png,6,How many total patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor?,Summing Weights,24,36,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many patients were discharged alive after going to the Floor.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to track all pathways where patients go to the Floor and are eventually discharged alive.

I can see two main paths where patients go to the Floor:
1. Emergency → Floor (41 patients)
2. ICU → Floor (24 patients)

From these Floor nodes, I need to follow where these patients go and count those who are discharged alive.

Path 1: Emergency → Floor (41 patients)
From this Floor node, I can see:
- 21 patients go to ICU
- The remaining must go to Discharge-Alive, but this link isn't explicitly labeled in the diagram. However, I can infer that 41 - 21 = 20 patients from Floor must go directly to Discharge-Alive.

Path 2: ICU → Floor (24 patients)
From this Floor node, I can see:
- 8 patients go to ICU (again)
- 16 patients go to Discharge-Alive (this link is clearly labeled)

So the total number of patients discharged alive after going to the Floor would be:
- 20 patients (Emergency → Floor → Discharge-Alive)
- 16 patients (ICU → Floor → Discharge-Alive)
= 36 patients total

However, I need to be careful about the first path. Since the link from Floor to Discharge-Alive isn't explicitly labeled in the diagram, I can't be completely certain about the 20 patients. But based on the flow of the diagram and the numbers shown, this appears to be the most logical conclusion.

q_42,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_10.png,2,How many total patients were discharged alive?,Summing Weights,62,83,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many total patients were discharged alive.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to identify all paths that lead to ""Discharge-Alive"" nodes and sum the values on those paths.

Starting from the top:
- We begin with 100 patients at ""_Start""
- All 100 flow to ""Arrival""
- From ""Arrival"", all 100 flow to ""Emergency""

From ""Emergency"", the patients split into different paths:
- 38 patients go directly to ""Discharge-Alive"" and then to ""_Exit""
- 21 patients go to ""Floor""
- 41 patients go to ""ICU""

Following the ""Floor"" path from Emergency:
- 21 patients go from ""Floor"" to ""Discharge-Alive"" (not explicitly shown but implied by the flow)

Following the ""ICU"" path:
- 41 patients enter ICU
- From ICU, 24 patients go to ""Floor""
- From ICU, 36 patients go to ""Die"" and then ""_Exit""

Following the second ""Floor"" path (from ICU):
- 24 patients go from this ""Floor"" to ""Discharge-Alive"" and then ""_Exit""

So the total number of patients discharged alive is:
- 38 (directly from Emergency to Discharge-Alive)
- 21 (from Emergency to Floor to Discharge-Alive)
- 24 (from Emergency to ICU to Floor to Discharge-Alive)
= 38 + 21 + 24 = 83 patients

q_44,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_10.png,4,How many total patients went to the ICU after Emrgency?,Summing Weights,62,41,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many total patients went to the ICU after Emergency.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to trace the pathways from the Emergency node to the ICU node.

From the Emergency node, I can see there are three outgoing paths:
1. Emergency → Floor (with value 21)
2. Emergency → Discharge-Alive (with value 38)
3. Emergency → ICU (with value 41)

The question asks specifically about patients who went to the ICU after Emergency. I can directly see that there is a path from Emergency to ICU with a value of 41.

This means that 41 patients went from Emergency directly to ICU.

I should also check if there are any other indirect paths from Emergency to ICU, but looking at the diagram, there are no other paths that go from Emergency to ICU through intermediate nodes. The only path is the direct one with 41 patients.

q_60,./Data/SentenTree/emergency_dataset/msp_25.png,2,How many total patients were discharged alive?,Accurately Read Edge Weights,38,64,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many total patients were discharged alive.

<reasoning>
Looking at the node-link diagram, I need to identify all pathways that lead to patients being discharged alive.

The diagram shows a flow of patients through a medical system:
- Starting with 100 patients at the ""Start"" node
- All 100 flow to ""Arrival""
- From ""Arrival"", all 100 flow to ""Emergency""
- From ""Emergency"", the flow splits:
  - 62 patients go to ""ICU""
  - 38 patients go directly to ""Discharge-Alive""
- From ""ICU"", the flow splits again:
  - 36 patients ""Die""
  - 26 patients reach ""_Exit"" (which appears to be a discharge)

To determine how many patients were discharged alive, I need to count all patients who followed pathways that indicate discharge with survival.

I can see:
1. 38 patients went directly from ""Emergency"" to ""Discharge-Alive"" and then to ""_Exit""
2. 26 patients went from ""ICU"" to ""_Exit"" (which appears to be a discharge pathway, separate from the ""Die"" pathway)

So the total number of patients discharged alive would be 38 + 26 = 64.

q_118,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_05.png,6,How many total shots were made by UMD offense?,Summing Weights,23,24,"I'll analyze the node-link diagram to determine how many total shots were made by UMD offense.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to identify all instances where UMD offense made shots. I'll trace through the pathways starting from the UMD Offense node.

From the UMD Offense node, I can see several paths:
1. UMD Offense → Made Shot → _Exit: This shows 3 direct made shots (shown by the link labeled ""3"")
2. UMD Offense → Foul → Made Free Throw → _Exit: This shows 6 made free throws (shown by the link labeled ""6"")
3. UMD Offense → Rebound → Made Shot → _Exit: This shows 15 made shots after rebounds (shown by the link labeled ""15"")

So the total shots made by UMD offense would be:
- 3 direct made shots
- 6 made free throws
- 15 made shots after rebounds

Adding these up: 3 + 6 + 15 = 24 total made shots by UMD offense.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to identify all shots made by UMD offense. 

From the ""UMD Offense"" node, I can see three paths:
1. UMD Offense → Rebound (34)
2. UMD Offense → Missed Shot (14)
3. UMD Offense → _Exit (21)

Following the ""Rebound"" path, it splits into:
- Rebound → Made Shot (15)
- Rebound → _Exit (19)

Following the ""Missed Shot"" path:
- Missed Shot → _Exit (14)

And from ""Made Shot"":
- Made Shot → _Exit (15)

To determine the total shots made by UMD offense, I need to count all instances where a shot was taken. In this diagram, shots are represented by:
1. The ""Made Shot"" node, which shows 15 made shots
2. The ""Missed Shot"" node, which shows 14 missed shots

Therefore, the total number of shots made by UMD offense is 15 + 14 = 29 shots.

q_148,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_25.png,4,How many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,34,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many shots were missed immediately after UMD Offense.

<reasoning>
Looking at the node-link diagram, I need to identify what happens immediately after ""UMD Offense"" and specifically count missed shots.

From the ""UMD Offense"" node, I can see two outgoing paths:
1. One path goes to ""Rebound"" with a value of 34
2. One path goes to ""_Exit"" with a value of 35

In basketball visualization context, a rebound typically occurs after a missed shot. When a shot is missed, the ball rebounds and can be recovered by either team. The fact that there's a direct path from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" with a count of 34 suggests that there were 34 instances where UMD's offensive possession resulted in a missed shot that led to a rebound.

The other path from ""UMD Offense"" goes directly to ""_Exit"" with a count of 35. This likely represents other outcomes that ended the UMD offensive possession (such as made shots, turnovers, fouls, etc.) but not missed shots.

Since the question specifically asks about missed shots immediately after UMD Offense, and rebounds occur after missed shots, the 34 sequences that went from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"" represent the missed shots.
</reasoning>

q_149,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_25.png,5,How many shots were made directly after a Rebound?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,0,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many shots were made directly after a Rebound.

<reasoning>
Looking at the node-link diagram, I need to identify where ""Rebound"" appears and then see if there are any links from the Rebound node to nodes that represent shots.

I can see the following nodes in the diagram:
- _Start (at the top)
- UNC Offense
- UMD Offense
- Rebound
- _Exit (appears twice in the diagram)

The diagram shows the following flow:
1. _Start → UNC Offense (with 69 sequences)
2. UNC Offense → UMD Offense (with 69 sequences)
3. UMD Offense splits into two paths:
   - UMD Offense → Rebound (with 34 sequences)
   - UMD Offense → _Exit (with 35 sequences)
4. Rebound → _Exit (with 34 sequences)

Looking specifically at what happens after a Rebound, I can see that there is only one outgoing link from the Rebound node, and it goes to _Exit with a value of 34. There are no links from Rebound to any node that represents a shot (such as ""Shot Made"" or ""Shot Missed"" or similar).

Since there are no links from Rebound to any shot-related nodes, there is no evidence in this diagram of shots being made directly after a Rebound. The only path shown after a Rebound is to _Exit.

q_150,./Data/CoreFlow/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_25.png,6,How many total shots were made by UMD offense?,Detect if edge is present,indeterminate,35,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many total shots were made by UMD offense.

<reasoning>
Looking at the node-link diagram, I can see the flow of events in a basketball game:

1. The diagram starts at ""_Start"" and flows down to ""UNC Offense"" with a value of 69.
2. From ""UNC Offense"", it flows to ""UMD Offense"" with a value of 69.
3. From ""UMD Offense"", the flow splits into two paths:
   - One path goes to ""Rebound"" with a value of 34
   - The other path goes to ""_Exit"" with a value of 35

To determine the total shots made by UMD offense, I need to understand what these paths represent. Since the question asks about ""shots made,"" I need to identify which path represents successful shots.

In basketball terminology:
- When a shot is made (successful), the possession typically ends
- When a shot is missed, it often results in a rebound

Therefore, the path from ""UMD Offense"" to ""_Exit"" with a value of 35 likely represents successful shots (made shots), while the path to ""Rebound"" with a value of 34 likely represents missed shots that resulted in rebounds.

The total number of shots taken by UMD offense would be the sum of both paths (35 + 34 = 69), but the question specifically asks for ""shots made,"" which would be 35.

q_161,./Data/SentenTree/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_05.png,1,How many rebounds were made after UMD Offense?,Summing Weights,34,7,"I'll analyze the node-link diagram to determine how many rebounds were made after UMD Offense.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to find the ""UMD Offense"" node and then trace all paths that lead to a ""Rebound"" node directly after it.

From the UMD Offense node, I can see several outgoing paths:
- A path with value 7 going to ""Foul""
- A path with value 8 going to ""_Exit""
- A path with value 16 going to ""Missed Shot""
- A path with value 4 going to ""Steal""

The question asks about rebounds after UMD Offense. Looking at these paths, I don't see a direct path from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"". However, I need to check if there's an indirect path through ""Missed Shot"" since missed shots often lead to rebounds.

Following the ""Missed Shot"" path (with value 16) from UMD Offense, I can see it connects to:
- A path with value 9 going to ""_Exit""
- A path with value 7 going to ""Rebound""

So there are 7 instances where UMD Offense led to a Missed Shot which then led to a Rebound.

I should also check if there are any other paths from UMD Offense that might lead to rebounds, but I don't see any other relevant connections in the diagram.

q_162,./Data/SentenTree/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/msp_05.png,2,How many times did UMD Offense transition from UNC Offense?,Summing Weights,60,36,"I'll analyze the node-link diagram to determine how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense.

<reasoning>
To answer this question, I need to find all direct links from ""UNC Offense"" node to ""UMD Offense"" node in the diagram.

Looking at the diagram, I can see the ""UNC Offense"" node near the top. From this node, I need to trace all paths that lead directly to ""UMD Offense"".

Examining the outgoing links from ""UNC Offense"", I see:
- A link to ""Foul"" with value 8
- A link to ""Rebound"" (right side) with value 23
- A link to ""Rebound"" (left side) with value 15
- A link to ""Turnover"" with value 9

None of these are direct links to ""UMD Offense"". So I need to follow these paths further to see if they eventually lead to UMD Offense.

Following the ""Turnover"" path:
- From ""Turnover"" there is a link with value 24 that leads to ""Made Free Throw""
- From this ""Made Free Throw"" node, there is a link with value 4 that connects to ""UMD Offense""

Following the ""Foul"" path:
- From ""Foul"" there is a link with value 5 to ""Made Free Throw""
- From this ""Made Free Throw"" node, there is a link with value 5 that connects to ""UMD Offense""

Following the right ""Rebound"" path:
- From right ""Rebound"" there is a link with value 4 to ""Made Shot""
- From ""Made Shot"" there is a link with value 27 that connects to ""UMD Offense""

Following the left ""Rebound"" path:
- From left ""Rebound"" there is a link with value 15 to ""Missed Shot""
- From ""Missed Shot"" there doesn't appear to be a direct path to ""UMD Offense""

So I've identified three paths from UNC Offense to UMD Offense:
1. UNC Offense → Turnover → Made Free Throw → UMD Offense: 4 transitions
2. UNC Offense → Foul → Made Free Throw → UMD Offense: 5 transitions
3. UNC Offense → Rebound → Made Shot → UMD Offense: 27 transitions

Adding these up: 4 + 5 + 27 = 36 total transitions from UNC Offense to UMD Offense.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to identify all paths that show made shots occurring after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.

Starting from UNC Offense, I can see several paths:
1. UNC Offense → Made Shot (with a value of 4)
   This is a direct path showing 4 made shots immediately after UNC Offense.

2. UNC Offense → Rebound → Made Shot
   I don't see a direct link from Rebound to Made Shot in this section.

3. UNC Offense → Foul → Made Free Throw (with a value of 5)
   This shows 5 made free throws after a foul.

4. Made Free Throw → Made Free Throw (with a value of 4)
   This shows 4 additional made free throws.

Before reaching UMD Offense, I need to count all made shots (including made free throws since these are also successful scoring events).

So the total count is:
- 4 (direct Made Shot from UNC Offense)
- 5 (Made Free Throw after Foul)
- 4 (second Made Free Throw)

Total: 4 + 5 + 4 = 13 made shots (including free throws) after UNC Offense but before UMD Offense.

<reasoning>
To answer this question, I need to identify all paths in the diagram where ""Missed Shot"" appears before ""UMD Offense"" in the sequence.

Looking at the diagram from top to bottom (chronological order):

1. Starting from the top, I see a ""Start"" node that connects to ""UNC Offense"" with 69 sequences.

2. From ""UNC Offense"", there's a path that leads to ""Missed Shot"" (through ""Rebound""):
   - ""UNC Offense"" → ""Rebound"" (15 sequences)
   - ""Rebound"" → ""Missed Shot"" (15 sequences)

3. From ""Missed Shot"", I need to check if there are paths that lead to ""UMD Offense"":
   - Looking at the diagram, I don't see a direct path from ""Missed Shot"" to ""UMD Offense""
   - Instead, ""Missed Shot"" connects to other nodes, but none of them directly connect to ""UMD Offense""

4. I also need to check if there are other ""Missed Shot"" nodes that occur before ""UMD Offense"":
   - There is a ""Missed Shot"" node that appears after ""UMD Offense"" (with 16 sequences going to it), but this doesn't count for our question since it occurs after UMD Offense
   - There's another ""Missed Shot"" node at the bottom part of the diagram, but this appears to be part of a sequence that occurs after ""UMD Offense"" as well

5. Looking more carefully at the flow, I can see that the ""Missed Shot"" (15) from UNC Offense doesn't have a clear path that leads to ""UMD Offense"". The diagram doesn't explicitly show how sequences flow from this ""Missed Shot"" to ""UMD Offense"".

Based on the visible connections in the diagram, I cannot determine with certainty how many missed shots occurred before UMD Offense. The diagram doesn't show a complete path that connects the ""Missed Shot"" node to ""UMD Offense"".

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to identify all nodes labeled ""Rebound"" and count the number of sequences that pass through these nodes.

I can see three ""Rebound"" nodes in the diagram:
1. A ""Rebound"" node after ""UNC Offense"" (top-left area)
2. A ""Rebound"" node after ""UNC Offense"" (top-right area)
3. A ""Rebound"" node after ""UMD Offense"" (bottom-left area)

For the first ""Rebound"" node (top-left):
- It has an incoming link with value 15 from ""UNC Offense""
- It has an outgoing link with value 15 to ""Missed Shot""

For the second ""Rebound"" node (top-right):
- It has an incoming link with value 23 from ""UNC Offense""
- It has an outgoing link with value 4 to ""Made Shot""

For the third ""Rebound"" node (bottom-left after UMD Offense):
- It has an incoming link with value 27 from ""UMD Offense""
- It has multiple outgoing links:
  - 4 to ""Foul""
  - 7 to ""Made Shot""
  - 6 to ""Missed Shot""
  - 4 to ""Turnover""
  - 4 to ""Exit""

Looking at the diagram, I need to find all paths that go from ""UMD Offense"" to ""Rebound"".

From the ""UMD Offense"" node, I can see several outgoing paths:
- One path with value 8 going to ""_Exit""
- One path with value 16 going to ""Missed Shot""
- One path with value 7 going to ""Foul""

To find rebounds after UMD Offense, I need to check if any of these paths eventually lead to a ""Rebound"" node.

Following the ""Missed Shot"" path from UMD Offense:
- There's a path with value 7 from ""Missed Shot"" to ""Rebound""
- There's also a path with value 9 from ""Missed Shot"" to ""_Exit""

So from the ""UMD Offense"" → ""Missed Shot"" → ""Rebound"" path, there are 7 rebounds.

I don't see any other paths from ""UMD Offense"" that lead to a ""Rebound"" node. The paths to ""_Exit"" and ""Foul"" don't connect to ""Rebound"" in this diagram.

Looking at the diagram, I need to identify all direct transitions from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"".

From the node ""UNC Offense"", I can see several outgoing paths:
1. UNC Offense → Made Shot (22)
2. UNC Offense → Missed Shot (15)
3. UNC Offense → Rebound (8)
4. UNC Offense → Foul (9)

I need to track which of these paths eventually lead to ""UMD Offense"" directly:

From ""Made Shot"", there's a path with value 22 that goes directly to ""UMD Offense"".
From ""Missed Shot"", there's a path with value 24 that goes directly to ""UMD Offense"".

I don't see any direct paths from ""Rebound"" or ""Foul"" to ""UMD Offense"".

Looking at the node-link diagram, I need to find direct transitions from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"" nodes.

I can see that the diagram shows various basketball game events and transitions between them. The nodes represent different states (UNC Offense, UMD Offense, Made Shot, Missed Shot, Rebound, etc.), and the directed links between them show transitions with numbers indicating the frequency of each transition.

<reasoning>
Looking at the node-link diagram, I need to find transitions from ""UNC Offense"" to ""UMD Offense"".

In this diagram:
- The top node is ""_Start"" which flows to ""UNC Offense"" (69 transitions)
- From ""UNC Offense"", there are two paths:
  - One path goes to ""Made Shot"" (22 transitions)
  - Another path goes to ""Missed Shot"" (24 transitions)
- From ""Made Shot"", there's a path to ""UMD Offense"" (22 transitions)
- From ""Missed Shot"", there's a path to ""UMD Offense"" (24 transitions)

To find how many times UMD Offense transitioned from UNC Offense, I need to count all paths that start at UNC Offense and end at UMD Offense. These transitions happen through intermediate nodes:
- UNC Offense → Made Shot → UMD Offense: 22 transitions
- UNC Offense → Missed Shot → UMD Offense: 24 transitions

So the total number of transitions from UNC Offense to UMD Offense is 22 + 24 = 46 transitions.

<reasoning>
Looking at the node-link diagram, I need to identify if there are any foul events between UNC Offense and UMD Offense.

Starting from the top:
1. The diagram begins with ""_Start"" which has 69 total sequences flowing from it
2. From ""_Start"", all 69 sequences flow to ""UNC Offense""
3. From ""UNC Offense"", the sequences split into two paths:
   - 22 sequences go to ""Made Shot""
   - 24 sequences go to ""Missed Shot""
   - These add up to 46 sequences (22+24=46)
4. Both ""Made Shot"" and ""Missed Shot"" then lead to ""UMD Offense""
   - 23 sequences go from ""Made Shot"" to ""UMD Offense""
   - 22 sequences go from ""Missed Shot"" to ""UMD Offense""

I notice that there are no nodes labeled ""Foul"" or anything similar between UNC Offense and UMD Offense. The only nodes between these two are ""Made Shot"" and ""Missed Shot"".

Additionally, I need to check if the numbers make sense:
- 22 sequences go to ""Made Shot"" but 23 come out of it to ""UMD Offense""
- 24 sequences go to ""Missed Shot"" but 22 come out of it to ""UMD Offense""

This suggests there might be some additional paths not shown or some counting discrepancy, but there are definitely no foul nodes visible in the diagram between UNC Offense and UMD Offense.

2. In the fifth column from the right:
   - Start (28) → UNC Offense (28) → Rebound (18) → Made Shot (16)
   These 16 made shots came after a rebound following UNC Offense, but not directly from UNC Offense alone.

3. In the leftmost column, I don't see any direct path from UNC Offense to Made Shot.

4. In the second column from the left, I don't see any direct path from UNC Offense to Made Shot.

Looking at the diagram, I need to find instances where UMD Offense made free throws. 

First, I need to identify all paths involving UMD Offense and look for any ""Made Free Throw"" nodes connected to UMD Offense.

Examining the diagram carefully, I can see:
1. There is a ""Made Free Throw"" node with a value of 12 in the second column.
2. This ""Made Free Throw"" node appears to follow from a ""Foul"" node (value 13).
3. The ""Made Free Throw"" node is not directly connected to ""UMD Offense"" - it appears to be connected to UNC Offense's possession sequence.

Looking at all instances of ""UMD Offense"" in the diagram:
- There's a ""UMD Offense"" node with value 7 in the rightmost column
- There's a ""UMD Offense"" node with value 18 in the fourth column
- There's a ""UMD Offense"" node with value 20 in the middle column
- There's a ""UMD Offense"" node with value 9 in the second column

None of these UMD Offense nodes are directly connected to any ""Made Free Throw"" nodes. The only ""Made Free Throw"" node in the diagram (with value 12) appears to be part of UNC's offensive sequence, not UMD's.

   So there are 2 made shots in this pathway.

2. Second column:
   - Start (13) → UNC Offense (13) → Foul (13) → Made Free Throw (12) → Exit (13)
   This shows 12 made free throws.

3. Third column:
   - Start (26) → UNC Offense (26) → Rebound (26) → Missed Shot (25) → UMD Offense (20) → ...
   - There's also a path that leads to Made Shot (9) after some rebounds
   Looking at this pathway, the 9 made shots appear to come after UMD Offense gets involved, so these aren't shots made by only UNC offense.

4. Fourth column:
   - Start (21) → UNC Offense (21) → Made Shot (20) → UMD Offense (18) → ...
   This shows 20 made shots by UNC offense.

5. Fifth column:
   - Start (7) → UNC Offense (7) → Turnover (4) → UMD Offense (7) → ...
   No made shots by UNC in this pathway.

Adding up all the made shots by UNC offense:

5. In the middle area: ""Made Free Throw"" with value 10
6. Below that: ""Made Free Throw"" with value 6

Adding these values:
2 + 7 + 3 + 17 + 10 + 6 = 45

This represents the total number of made shots (including free throws) by both teams according to the diagram.

<reasoning>
Looking at the diagram, I need to identify all instances where ""Made Free Throw"" nodes appear and are associated with UMD Offense.

I can see two ""Made Free Throw"" nodes in the diagram:
1. One ""Made Free Throw"" node with a value of 10
2. Another ""Made Free Throw"" node with a value of 6

To determine if these are associated with UMD Offense, I need to trace the pathways:

For the first ""Made Free Throw"" (value 10):
- This appears to follow from a ""Foul"" node (value 9)
- The foul occurs after a ""Rebound"" (value 5)
- This sequence is part of a pathway that starts with UNC Offense

For the second ""Made Free Throw"" (value 6):
- This also appears in a sequence that starts with UNC Offense
- It follows after the first ""Made Free Throw""

Both of these ""Made Free Throw"" nodes appear to be in sequences where UMD is on offense after UNC had possession. Since free throws are awarded to the team that was fouled, and these free throws occur after a foul when UNC was on offense, these free throws would be taken by UMD.

Therefore, adding the values:
10 + 6 = 16 free throws made by UMD Offense.

q_244,./Data/Sequence Synopsis/umdvsunc_D2O_basketball/alpha_30.png,7,How many shots were made by only the UNC offense?,Summing Weights,19,17,"I'll analyze this node-link diagram to determine how many shots were made by only the UNC offense.

<reasoning>
To answer this question, I need to identify all instances where UNC Offense made shots in the diagram. I'll trace through all pathways that involve UNC Offense and look for ""Made Shot"" nodes that directly follow UNC Offense actions.

Looking at the diagram from left to right:

1. First column:
   - Starts with ""UNC Offense"" (value 2)
   - Leads to ""Jump Ball"" (1) and ""Missed Shot"" (2)
   - Then ""Made Shot"" (2) appears lower in the sequence
   - This shows 2 made shots by UNC Offense

2. Second column:
   - Starts with ""UNC Offense"" (value 14)
   - Leads to ""Rebound"" (14)
   - Then ""Missed Shot"" (14)
   - No direct ""Made Shot"" from UNC Offense in this pathway

3. Third column:
   - Starts with ""UNC Offense"" (value 12)
   - Leads to ""Rebound"" (5) and ""Foul"" (9)
   - Then ""Made Free Throw"" (10) and ""Made Free Throw"" (6)
   - These are free throws resulting from fouls, not direct shots

4. Fourth column:
   - Starts with ""UNC Offense"" (value 14)
   - Leads to ""Steal"" (6)
   - No direct ""Made Shot"" from UNC Offense

5. Fifth column:
   - Starts with ""UNC Offense"" (value 9)
   - Leads to ""Missed Shot"" (9)
   - No direct ""Made Shot"" from UNC Offense

6. Sixth column:
   - Starts with ""UNC Offense"" (value 18)
   - Leads to ""Made Shot"" (17)
   - This shows 17 made shots by UNC Offense

Adding up all the direct ""Made Shot"" nodes that follow UNC Offense:
- From column 1: 2 made shots
- From column 6: 17 made shots
- Total: 2 + 17 = 19 made shots by UNC Offense

However, I need to be careful about my interpretation. Looking more closely at column 1, the ""Made Shot"" (2) doesn't directly follow ""UNC Offense"" but appears after ""Missed Shot"". This suggests these 2 made shots might not be directly from UNC Offense's initial possession.

Looking at column 6, there's a direct link from ""UNC Offense"" (18) to ""Made Shot"" (17), which clearly indicates 17 made shots by UNC Offense.

Therefore, based on the diagram, I can confidently identify 17 shots that were made directly by UNC Offense.
