## Context You are presented with a node-link diagram visualization that shows sequences of events: 
- Each event is represented by a node with a label 
- Events are connected by directed links forming pathways 
- The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom) 
- Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path 
- Numeric labels next to each link show the exact count of sequences 

## Instructions 
- Carefully examine all nodes, links, labels, and their corresponding values 
- Track complete pathways through the diagram to understand event sequences 
- Answer **solely** based on what is explicitly shown in the visualization 
- If the answer **cannot be determined** from the visualization, respond with 'indeterminate'

- Events are connected by directed links forming pathways 
- The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom) 
- Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path 
- Numeric labels next to each node show the exact count of sequences 

## Instructions 
- Carefully examine all nodes, links, labels, and their corresponding values 
- Track complete pathways through the diagram to understand event sequences 
- Answer **solely** based on what is explicitly shown in the visualization 
- If the answer **cannot be determined** from the visualization, respond with 'indeterminate' 

## Response Format 
1. Identify the relevant elements in the visualization that inform your answer 
2. Describe your thought process and calculations clearly step-by-step in XML tag <reasoning>, showing how you analyzed the diagram

- Each event is represented by a node with a label 
- Events are connected by directed links forming pathways 
- The vertical position of nodes indicates chronological order (top to bottom) 
- Link widths are proportional to the number of sequences following that path 
- Numeric labels next to each node show the exact count of sequences 

## Instructions 
- Carefully examine all nodes, links, labels, and their corresponding values 
- Track complete pathways through the diagram to understand event sequences 
- Answer **solely** based on what is explicitly shown in the visualization 
- If the answer **cannot be determined** from the visualization, respond with 'indeterminate'
